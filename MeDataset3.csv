will drinking diet soda affect my concerta medication,a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin hcg however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until 13 to 16 days after ovulation the release of an egg which is around the time that you would normally get your period until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment source   pharmacysell

did my currentonly partner of 2 and 12 months give me chlamydia,you are looking for a gynecologist who specializes in tubal ligation reversal not all ob gyns perform this procedure so you may have to spend some time finding just the right person it is worth noting tubal ligation reversal is not successful in all cases women who had tubal ligation using rings or clips generally seem to have the best results from reversal surgery older women who had large sections of the fallopian tube removed may have less success with reversal reversing a tubal ligation is not exactly easy  the process involves a number of pre  and post operative steps the surgery itself is generally performed under general anesthesia the post surgery pregnancy rate can range from 40 to 85 i mention these things for women reading this post who may be considering having their tubes tied make sure it is something you absolutely positively want to do because it is not a decision you can easily reverse tubal ligation is intended to be permanent birth control if you have doubts about whether or not you really want to give up the ability to have children in the future then i suggest you opt for an intrauterine contraceptive device iud or something non permanent you can always get your tubes tied later wishing you well

male pelvic pain frequent urination sometimes feels like there is a gas bubble in pelvis area had unprotected sex started to have frequent urination the day after went to clinic got tested for bladder infection ghonnoreachlamdyia multiple times all came back negative prescribed norfloxacin doxycycline levofloxacin and still have symptons doxycycline seemed to work the best because symptons went away for about a week have seen multiple doctors and none no what it is have a urologist appt feb 11 just looking for some input on what it may be have not had sex recently no fever,i am sorry to hear you are going through this it sounds very uncomfortable and i am glad to hear you are seeing a specialist because you need to get to the bottom of what is going on a couple of points it is entirely possible the symptoms are unrelated to the unprotected sexual encounter whenever we humans experience new symptoms we tend to want to attribute their cause to any recent unusual experience however it is entirely possible for physical symptoms to arise independent of any coincidental event when the lining of the bladder becomes irritated it can stay irritated for some time when a person empties his bladder frequently it can allow the lining of the flaccid bladder to rub against itself which can cause further irritation i suggest you try ignoring the urge to urinate frequently and instead allow your bladder to collect a fair amount of fluid before you let it out although it may feel uncomfortable at the time you may discover it eventually gives you some relief it is good news that you tested negative for various types of infections and that you have no fever that pretty much rules out any infectious processes going on i hope you get some answers from the urologist i have worked with patients who had bladder symptoms like you describe and they eventually just cleared up on their own maybe this will be the case for you too wishing you well

our 6yo had 1 dose of benadryl in the earlier did not work how many hours must we wait to give him 5mg cetirizine  for two days prior we gave him single doses of claritin which did not work well we tried one does of benadryl around lunch today and after a day outside his allergies are terrible at bedtime would like to try certirizine childrens thanks in advance,it is impossible to answer your question because the answer is different for every single substance what you are really asking is how long does it take the body to metabolize break down and eliminate various legal and illegal drugs the prescribing information for legal medications includes the drug is half life  the half life is the length of time it takes the body to metabolize half the active ingredient thus if the half life of a drug is 12 hours it means half of the active ingredient will still be circulating in your blood 12 hours after you take the medication that gives you some idea of how long it takes the body to metabolize that particular drug however we are not talking about a perfectly curved graph when it comes to drug metabolism you should not assume if a drug has a 12 hour half life that all of it will be eliminated from your system in 24 hours it might be or maybe it will all be eliminated at the 18 hour mark pharmacokinetics is a precise science in terms of illegal drugs think of it this way if you take no illegal drugs they will stay in your system for exactly zero hours for drug testing purposes in other words if you avoid taking illegal drugs you need not worry about drug testing anyway you should not be taking illegal drugs i am excluding marijuana from this category simply because some states have now legalized it my exclusion of marijuana does not imply i endorse or approve of using it  there are a whole host of problems that go along with taking illegal drugs    one of which is you do not really know what you are taking there is no safe dosing level they interact very badly with prescription medications the list goes on best bet if you know you are going to be subjected to random or routine drug tests make sure you have a valid prescription for any medication that might turn up positive and avoid taking illegal drugs wishing you well

im late on my period could i be pregnant  i hooked up with a guy the day after my period ended and now im 4 days late on this moths period i gave him a blowjob and he came in my mouth then we were going to have sex with a condom on but he couldnt get hard again so i gave him another blowjob with the condom on and then he put it in we ended up not having sex but his penis touched my vagina is it possible that the residue of cum from my mouth passed onto the condom when i gave him a blowjob with it on could get me pregnant,the first step in doing kegel exercises is to find the right muscles imagine that you are trying to stop yourself from passing gas squeeze the muscles you would use if you sense a pulling feeling those are the right muscles for pelvic exercises do not squeeze other muscles at the same time or hold your breath also be careful not to tighten your stomach leg or buttock muscles squeezing the wrong muscles can put more pressure on your bladder control muscles squeeze just the pelvic muscles pull in the pelvic muscles and hold for a count of three then relax for a count of three repeat but do not overdo it work up to three sets of 10 repeats start doing your pelvic muscle exercises lying down this position is the easiest for doing kegel exercises because the muscles then do not need to work against gravity when your muscles get stronger do your exercises sitting or standing working against gravity is like adding more weight be patient do not give up it takes just five minutes three times a day your bladder control may not improve for three to six weeks although most people notice an improvement after a few weeks

when i do not poop for 3 to 4 days my back hurts bad when i finally do go i have at least 5 times in a few hours,i am sorry to hear you are having problems with your bowels let is see what we can do about that it is not necessarily abnormal to poop only once every three or four days bowel regularity varies from person to person some people have a bowel movement every day or multiple times a day and other people go less frequently however since you are having back pain when you do not poop we are going to consider you might have constipation to keep your bowels regular try doing these things drink plenty of water everyone says oh i drink a lot of water  but if your stool poop is hard or you are not pooping then you probably do not drink enough water drink more eat vegetables veggies contain a lot of fiber which helps your bowels work properly aim for at least 5 serving of vegetables every day and i do not mean processed vegetables like french fries eat raw or slightly cooked veggies for best nutrition exercise movement is one key to keeping your bowels healthy try to exercise for at least 30 minutes every day even if it is just walking doing those three things may keep you from having any episodes of constipation but if your bowels do stop moving try these things increase the amount of water you are drinking try drinking prune juice or eating dried plums prunes try taking a fiber laxative like benefiber or metamucil try taking a stool softener like docusate sodium try drinking milk of magnesia if your bowels become regular but you still notice the back pain it is time to see a doctor you will want to rule out anything serious like colon cancer wishing you well hi try changing your diet to a good healthy diet cut out all fast and junk foods cut out all soda drinks even diet sodas and energy drinks you do need some good fibre going into your body daily either from fruits and vegetables think of the 5 a day drinking water through the day helps and doing plenty of exercise all helps getting your body going hope this helps you good luck

do fillers work better when used in conjunction with botox,recent studies show that a combination treatment of botox and fillers works better than either treatment alone botox and fillers such as restylane perlane prevelle juvederm and radiesse perform differently botox paralyzes the underlying facial muscle while fillers plump the skin and smooth out fine lines and wrinkles young people with only superficial lines may just need mainly botox but botox is not going to make deep forehead furrows or marionette linesthe vertical creases that run from mouth to chin disappear – for that people need fillers the problem with fillers is that sooner or later they break down and are absorbed by the body the more animated and active the face the faster the filler will break down prevelle one of the lighter fillers lasts about four months while perlane and juvederm ultra plus last about eight months to a year however the duration of any filler will significantly increase if botox shots are given first in the same sitting for the forehead for example i inject botox into the lines followed immediately by fillers instead of the usual five to six months with a smooth forehead if a filler alone is used the combination treatment will last nine to ten months and the forehead will look a whole lot better during that time because the etched in lines will be smoothed away botox and fillers can even be used around the mouth which is where fillers break down fastest think about it your mouth is in constant movement every waking moment and the more movement there is the faster the filler will break down botox should never be injected into the smile lines but diluted botox shots can be used successfully with fillers on the lips and the corners of the mouth on most people there are exceptions though people who need extremely mobile lips for their professions such as singers or horn players should never get botox near their mouths although they can have fillers

food if i am rushing to eat seems to get “stuck” without a sip of water is it a esophageal disorder,the main cause of emphysema is smoking which activates inflammatory cells in the lung this inflammation causes 1 swelling within the bronchioles and 2 activation of enzymes called proteases which attack and destroy lung tissue the alveolar wall structures there is a genetic predisposition to emphysema the relatively rare condition known as alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is the genetic deficiency of a chemical that protects the lung from damage by proteases emphysema is also a component of aging as the lungs get older the elastic properties decrease and the tensions that develop can result in small areas of emphysema other less common causes of emphysema include intravenous drug use in which some of the non drug additives like corn starch can be toxic to lung tissue immune deficiencies in which infections like pneumocystis carinii can cause inflammatory changes in the lung connective tissue illnesses ehlers danlos syndrome marfan syndrome in which abnormal elastic tissue in the body can cause alveoli to fail in underdeveloped countries a common cause of emphysema is indoor air pollution in these populations it is very common to have indoor stoves in the kitchen the smoke from cooking results in the damage to the lungs

i am facing premature ejaculation how do i overcome it,i completely emphasize with you the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more honestly most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation regarding your problem pertaining to non retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness non retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections so make an appointment with a general surgeon for further queries consult a sexologist online   > <link>

under health care reform when will there be fewer restrictions on mental health sessions  why is an insurance company allowed to limit how many therapy sessions a patient can have a year,last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health insurance plans — typically offered by employers — from restricting access to care by limiting mental health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 mhpaea in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need right now if you have not been able to find health insurance due to a pre existing mental health condition you may be able to access the new pre existing condition insurance plan starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a “pre existing condition” – and insurers also will not be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums also in 2014 mental health and substance use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid these reforms all work to make the health insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental health and substance abuse disorders

what does it mean when you exercise and sweat and then begin to itch,hi just been doing a little bit more research and found this small piece of info see when you start doing research as you know you have to fight your way through lots of rubbish but this come out of the rubbish you may like to copy it and show your doctor of all things its from the uk is daily mail its a daily news paper see what you think breast size is essentially determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors while genes are beyond our control lifestyle modifications may be effective in reducing bust size the main hormone that determines breast size is oestrogen the more oestrogen you have in your system the bigger your breasts will tend to be this is why women often find that their breasts enlarge when they take oestrogen based medication such as the combined pill a mix of oestrogen and progesterone or hrt as far reducing your bust size is concerned i would therefore advise you to avoid using the combined pill in addition it is important for you to be aware that traces of oestrogen from the pill are excreted in the urine and may make it into the water supply oestrogen like compounds also known as xeno oestrogens from plastic packaging including plastic bottles and industrial residues are also known to contaminate food and drinks for these reasons i would advise you to drink mineral water from glass bottles whenever possible and avoid processed foods packaged in plastic meat and possibly some dairy products tend to contain oestrogen and should also be moderated in the diet oestrogen is broken down in the liver so anything you do to improve liver function might help eating a diet based on wholefoods fruits and vegetables preferably organic with plenty of water and very little caffeine and alcohol should help to maximise your liver function and minimise the impact of oestrogen in your body you might also try a supplement of the herb agnus castus one of this herb is chief effects is to increase the level of the hormone progesterone which tends to help moderate and balance the effects of oestrogen in the body the normal recommended dose of agnus castus is 40 mg of dried herb or 40 drops of concentrated liquid extract once a day or 20 mg of dried herb twice a day agnus castus preparations are readily available in health food stores its the part on the liver that could point the way to your problem perhaps something is going wrong there when it comes to your hormones good luck

why was i prescribed with folic acid glycomet and oosure for delayed period,first off let me just clarify that not everyone who takes a diuretic water pill needs to take a potassium supplement diuretics come in two general types potassium sparing and non potassium sparing also called loop diuretics most of the newer diuretics are potassium sparing which means they do not strip potassium from the body the way loop diuretics do the reason i want to clarify this is because patients who take loop diuretics like lasix furosemide should always receive a prescription for potassium from their doctor if you are taking a diuretic and did not receive a prescription for potassium they you may not need to take any extra potassium potassium is a key mineral for heart health but too much or too little potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat thus it is not always a good idea to take a potassium supplement if a person wants to make sure they are getting enough potassium they should consider eating potassium rich foods like sweet potatoes tomato sauces and beans this is a safer way to get potassium than taking a pill    unless a medical professional tells you to take a pill wishing you well

is levocetirizine sufficient to cure nasal congestion and cough,your infection will be most probably a viral infection because of the season now however we can be sure of that only after a swab is taken and it is cultured to see if there grows any bacteria in it i give you the following suggestions to take care of the problem however only after a thorough examination i will able to arrive at a more confirm diagnosis and institute decisive treatment levocetirizine can be continued in the night alone mostly the dose prescribed is 5 mg for cough try some cough lozenges which can be taken orally some expectorant syrup will help lighten the mucus and help cough the sputum out better if you get fever take paracetamol 650 mg take abundant rest if fever ensues if fever present then it is prudent to consult a doctor and take the appropriate antibiotics cold and nasal congestion can be alleviated using nasal decongestant drops like xylometazoline 0 1 or oxymetazoline 0 05 take three drops in each nostril and lie down for 10 minutes thereafter take steam inhalation this i suggest you to do twice daily for three days take salt water gargles three to four times a day take plenty of hot fluids and refrain from having any cold products or drinks avoid smoking and drinking during the course of all these medications better to avoid them altogether if fever does not relieve then you must consult a doctor it could be worsening and you may require antibiotics or injections if you get throat pain then it is a sign of inflammation and salt water gargles will be helpful because of throat infection your nodes may get enlarged and become painful if cough is not productive and if it is dry you should be seen by a doctor to ascertain if any wheeze is present if so you have to take bronchodilators to ease the bronchial passages for air and mucus to pass through as the details provided are insufficient and i have not examined you i cannot be decisive whether the infection is a viral or bacterial one i cannot be sure regarding whether the upper respiratory tract presentation is of some other disease like dengue leptospirosis h1n1 etc however the latter chances are less do not worry for now but promptly consult with a doctor in case you are not relieved of symptoms here i would like to emphasize the importance of green leafy vegetables to be taken daily nutritious protein rich food regular exercise and breathing exercise which if performed regularly can help prevent such infections differential diagnosis1 viral rhinopharyngitis 2 acute upper respiratory tract infection regarding follow upfor further information consult an allergy specialist online    > <link>

i am having right lower abdominal pain that increases with standing and taking deep breaths in what might this be,well it is hard to say a number of conditions could be causing the pain you describe unless you are running a fever you probably can safely take a watchful waiting approach to see if the situation improves if you begin to run a fever you definitely should seek medical attention lower right quadrant pain frequently is associated with appendicitis by the way appendicitis is considered a medical emergency so if you spike a fever and the pain gets worse you have won a ticket to the er however many other non emergency things could cause the pain you are describing for example a piece of hard stool could be stuck in the intestine temporarily this is a frequent cause of abdominal pain of all kinds in this case the stool eventually moves on and the pain goes away even a pocket of intestinal gas could cause the symptoms you describe as always my usual advice in any medical situation is this if things start moving toward worse instead of better  see your health care provider meanwhile get a thermometer do not rely on whether or not you feel hot to the touch or anything of that sort monitor your temperature every four hours is fine and just keep close tabs on the situation chances are it will clear up on its own wishing you well

i am a male and a girl gives me oral sex and i do not ejaculate will she get oral or genital herpes,hot flashes are a huge factor for women when they sleep uh i had one patient call them power surges where in the middle of the night she just had all of this heat and all of this energy and had a really tough time going back to bed believe it or not there are some interesting products on the market that are pretty cool for this there are these things called wicking pajamas now this is very similar to the dry fit or the things that you see the athletes wear but it actually works much the way a wick does so a wick in a candle actually pulls the wax up into the wick otherwise if you lit the wick it would just burn straight through the candle so these wicking pajamas are actually quite effective there are other things that you can do believe it or not there is a device out there a chillable pillow that you can use and there is an insert that you put into it and it allows for because remember you lose most of your heat through your head and that is where you feel a lot of your heat to again maintain sort of a constant temperature but if your hormones go kooky you are going to have a hot flash whether you like it or not the same process is done with these wicking pajamas is it pulls the sweat off of you then there is a second layer that is got a very large surface area and allows the sweat to evaporate so women are not waking up in soaking wet clothing being cold because what happens is they get this hot flash or power surge they begin to sweat to reduce that temperature and then all of a sudden their clothing is wet and they have already made their bedroom as cold as humanly possible and then they get the shakes or they get the shivers and they are not feeling so great

do i need to see my doctor about decreased appetite and nausea  for the last few weeks to a month i have noticed a marked decreased in my appetite i can only eat about half the amount of food i used to eat before i feel extremely full also every morning i have nausea that wont go away until i eat even though it makes food sound completely unappetizing a mild amount of bowel irritation has also come and gone a few times as well the only medication i take is 20mg antidepressant tablets citalopram hydrobromide could this be something serious,most helpful answer if they need or deserve kissing go for it while some studies have shown that herpes simplex type 1 fever blisters cold sores can potentially be spread when no active lesions are present this would certainly be less likely obviously kissing someone who has an active herpetic lesion especially if you have never had them would not be a good idea tens of millions of people in the united states have recurrent herpes simplex lesions on the lips from time to time it would be a shame if no one ever kissed them again

are there pain medications available that do not make you constipated,chlamydia can live in the throat the vagina the anus or the inside of the penis so it is the location that called infection it was the infection in the location that caused the problem having unprotected sex in any body orifice puts the person at risk for an std as you may know not all stds are obvious to the person who has them so unless they are specifically tested and properly quite frequently they can acquire an unwanted gift like chlamydia recreational sex is risky if you do not practice safe sex chlamydia is not the only std out there but at least it is one that can be treated and cured some of the others not so much

are there vaccines available to prevent poison ivy,the actual minimal number of calories that you can safely eat long term depends on your basal metabolic rate bmr which is the energy necessary for your body and its organs to maintain normal function while simply at rest although there are equations to calculate bmr such as the harris benedict equation these are all theoretical estimations and your actual number could vary there are other more accurate methods to calculate your bmr through either direct or indirect calorimetry techniques that usually measure gas exchange between oxygen consumption and co2 production you could do an internet search to find test facilities near you for these methods if you are genuinely curious otherwise the bmr equations might give you a good enough estimate you are correct in stating that 1 200 calories is typically the conventional lower threshold value given and i think that it is fair to use as an estimate for most of the general population again your actual number will vary by far however 800 calories per day would be considered a very low calorie diet vlcd because it would be very hard to meet your nutritional needs with so few calories this type of diet would generally not be recommended for individuals who are not obese and who do not have proper medical supervision your doctor will take your specific circumstances into consideration before helping you decide if you should go on a vlcd and you may need to work with a dietitian to develop a specific eating plan to help ensure that you meet your nutrient needs while following the diet it is important to note that although vlcds have been shown to lower weight and help with obesity related conditions like hypertension diabetes or high cholesterol in obese individuals they do not seem to be any more effective than a more modest dietary eating plan long term you will likely regain any weight loss after going off the vlcd unless you transition into a healthy eating plan while incorporating regular exercise which is another aspect of why medical supervision from your doctor or a dietitian would be essential
i have shingles and was with my daughter who just found out she is pregnant is there a danger to the fetus,there is really not much point in washing your face before exercise you need to cleanse your skin after exercising and sweating in order to make sure you do not develop blocked pores or possible fungal infections of the skin interestingly it is equally important to thoroughly dry your skin after exercising fungal infections such as  jock itch  can arise if the skin stays damp so be sure to towel off thoroughly and perhaps apply powder if you can not get completely dry ps women can get jock itch  too hope this helps

is tylenol safe to use for “flu” symptoms caused by interferon for hepatitis c treatment is motrin safer,tylenol acetaminophen is toxic to the liver in large doses such as in suicidal attempts where a patient ingests large amounts often more than 10 grams of the medication and also in situations where a patient drinks alcohol heavily while taking high doses of tylenol tylenol with alcohol ingestion can be toxic to the liver with lower doses of tylenol than without the alcohol otherwise for the general population both tylenol and motrin ibuprofen an nsaids have low 1 liver toxicity at the regular recommended doses moreover both drugs can usually be used in the recommended doses prescribed by a physician reasonably safely for the flu symptoms caused by interferon used for treating chronic hepatitis c with advanced complicated cirrhosis from hepatitis c for which interferon is rarely used all drugs including these must be prescribed with great caution if at all in addition in these patients with advanced cirrhosis nsaids including motrin can worsen or even precipitate hepatorenal syndrome a serious condition with both liver and kidney failure and possibly cause intestinal bleeding

does taking contraceptive pills before and after sex avoid pregnancy,i am sorry to hear you are going through this osteomyelitis is no fun that is for sure the only way you will find out the answer to your question is to ask somnolence sleepiness is one of the main side effects of opioid pain relievers like morphine and oxycodone often the first treatment for excessive somnolence in opioid users is to reduce the dosage if that is impossible in your case then your doctor may consider prescribing something to offset the drowsiness if you are experiencing severe sleepiness due to opioid use you need to be extremely careful about driving cooking for example using knives or a food processor operating machinery or any tasks that require keen awareness you also need to make sure you are not so highly medicated that your breathing slows or stops regularly check your lips to make sure they do not have a bluish tint around the edges and make sure your finger nailbeds stay pink as well if you see any bluishness around your mouth or in your nailbeds you should contact your doctor right away as these can be signs of an accidental opioid overdose i just want to add that your pain should not keep you bedridden  you should do everything you can to stay active whether this means using crutches a cane or even a wheelchair but do not stay in bed because then you are putting yourself at risk for a blood clot and you do not need that on top of everything else good luck to you

female 47 yrs red scaly rash on my neck for several months tinea barbarae was dx by dr did not cure cause cure  dr prescribed clotrimazole and betamethasone diproplonate cream this did not cure the problem at all did not even relieve the situation over the counter lotions seem to make the rash worse i need to know the cause the and cure thank you,i am sorry you are going through this and that the medications did not give you any relief when symtpoms persist after treatment it is always a good idea to return to the doctor to update him or her and get reevaluated i would suggest you do just that tinea barbae is a type of folliculitis which is an inflammation of the hair follicle the part of the hair that is embedded in your skin caused by an infection tinea barbae is caused by a fungus which is why your health care provider prescribed an anti fungal cream clotrimazole to treat it however since that did not work it is time to get the rash re checked i would suggest you also share with your doctor that over the counter lotions and creams made the rash worse if possible tell him or her specifically which items you used that may help get you a better diagnosis good luck to you

what does egfr indicate is 52 something to worry about  recently had a comprehensive metabolic blood panel included creatinine 1 07 which was indicated to be high included egfr 52 which was indicated to be low there is kidney disease in my family and i am wondering if these two tests are related and if they indicate a beginning of kidney disease if so what should i do about it can these values be changed via the diet my age is 71 i also have high blood pressure my bun was 24 and the buncreatinine ratio is 22 thank you for your help,there has to be a reason for the cholesterol to be high a vegetarian diet can be one of eating absolutely no dairy or animal meat products or one of just avoiding meats if you are a true vegetarian and eat no dairy or animal products you will have to look at your source of fats and protein are you using any fats that are not healthy fats such as hydrogenated oils or oils that form trans fats when digested if you find the source of the cholesterol you can eliminate your problem your body cannot make bad cholesterol if you do not supply it with the ingredients to do so try limiting your fats to only a good nut fat such as almond and or a good seed like flax or sunflower for a month and see what your results are another thing you say you are eating whole grain only is this processed grain try eating unprocessed grains or less processed grains than products made from highly processed flours or try a product made from a non grain seeds such as millet flour the more a grain is processed the more good parts of it are destroyed or reduced leaving you with a starch that will undoubtedly ferment while digesting how many processed foods do you eat is your vegetarian diet from fresh fruits and veggies or is it from “canned” or processed foods laden with salts and unlabeled fats 3rdly and last what is the ph status of your blood most diets consist of highly acidic causing foods which causes your body to store excess acid in the fats of your body you say you are overweight this could be a major reason since even though you are “vegetarian” you are still overweight get a few ph strips or paper and check your first urine in the morning if it is under 7 0 on the ph scale this may be part of the problem genetics can play a role also but i really think this is more of a crutch for most people i was told i would be on my cholesterol meds for the rest of my life as my whole family had high blood pressure and high cholesterol i changed my lifestyle of eating and am now off all my meds with a total cholesterol of 145 by doing so i am diabetic also and have been able to eliminate all my meds i follow a lifestyle of eating called the ph “diet” you ought to look into it to see if it can help you too just google it and read about it it is a sort of vegetarian diet but just a little different there are several good books on the ph diet out there some a little more radicle and hard to follow but most with a common sense attitude of diet one can follow one thing you have to want something bad enough to make it happen good luck
how much salt does a person need,i do not know your age or if people in your family get grey or white hair but this could be a normal age related change i do not think that it would likely be due to your stress i do not know if it will turn your normal color again i suspect that this will likely be permanent if you do not like this distinguishing change you can put some hair dye on them if there are only a few you can pull out the white ones but there is not guarantee that new white ones will grow in its place
what can cause a 10 year old boy is head of hair to change from black to reddish brown in a matter of hours  my 10 year old was playing in the back yard but then started having a slight headache when he came inside i notice his hair on one side was changing in color from black to light brown i also notice he had what looked like 2 mosquito bites on his arms he had no temperature but was feeling a bit fatigued but we went on to basketball practice none the less by the end of the evening his entire head of hair was now the color reddish brown,i would suggest you to first of all go for an x ray and then you can decide how to proceed for now you can take pain relievers muscle relaxant and do cool packs on the painful area you can wear orthotics in your shoes to support and relieve pain avoid exerting too much and loose weight if you are over weight hope this helps

what are some suggestions for moving on after a relationship ends,moving on from a relationship is extremely difficult especially when you still love the person while keeping yourself busy and time are very helpful in moving on they are not the only things you need to do you must find things that you can invest yourself in   find things that matter to you without this the keeping busy will only provide very temporary relief  in talking yourself through this imagine that the old you is a friend think about what you were going through at the time and bring back how it all felt then talk to that old you as you would talk to a friend give her understanding cry with her let her know that she is more than her actions at that time that you can understand why she acted as she did and that she is still a good person and lovable    that is how you would feel toward and respond to a friend right this will take time to work through but with effort persistence and a caring feeling toward yourself you can slowly help yourself heal if all of this feels too hard to do and you do not have a trusted friend who can help you through this then you might consider finding a therapist to help
why am i not menstruating  i am 19 years old and i have not had a period in 6 months i can 100 guarantee i am not pregnant i am not overweight i do not exercise really intensely and i do not really have anything to seriously stress about i moved back in january but i have had a period since then so i do not think stress from that is the problem i have chronic constipation which may or may not be ibs could that be what is causing this i want to make sure before i go get looked at and told that is what it is,recurring respiratory infections and stomach infections are indicative of compromised or low immunity he is at an early age and the immunity can be improved by giving him appropriate diets that should be a blend of green vegetables fruits eggs nuts meat milk while grains legumes etc multivitamin supplements can help make him drink sufficient water and also take sufficient sleep make him play outdoors and be physically active hope this helps regards

can shingles rash not have blisters my boyfriend has had shingles before but this rash he has is very large from his groin to all the way down his inner thigh on one side it is red and blotchy on the outside of the rash but the red blotches on the inside are very light no blisters and apparently has had this rash for over 6 months,if you have been on blood pressure medication for two years and the cold feet are a new symptom then it is unlikely your medication is the cause however any new symptom is a good reason to visit your health care provider and get checked out low blood pressure can cause cold hands and feet but it is relatively uncommon more often cold feet are caused by poor circulation this in turn can be caused by many other things such as diabetes peripheral vascular disease or even raynaud is phenomenon your best bet is to see your health care provider to discover what is causing your cold feet after a physical exam your provider might order a few more tests to get to the bottom of this    and help get your feet warm again
can rapid weight loss actually be causing me to have higher blood pressure  my bicycle is my main transportation i live in az and i ride an avg of 8 miles a day and have lost over 50 lbs in the last 10 wks i have been overweight all my life and always had high blood pressure my blood pressure has been lower than it has been in over 20 yrs until about 2 3 wks ago it is trending back up with no dietary change or decrease in exercise can dehydration or not enough cool down time from physical activity be to blame,i cannot find any evidence showing that rapid weight loss causes blood pressure to rise in general weight loss typically helps to reduce blood pressure it is important to remember that other factors can affect blood pressure such as genetics age stress and certain medical conditions i suggest making an appointment with your healthcare provider to help you figure it out its unlikely that dehydration or not cooling down could be the cause here is an article with more common causes of high blood pressure hypertension
is it true that using two condoms are better than one,our society generally believes two is better than one the problem is that the way condoms are designed using two condoms at the same time could actually do more harm than good it could cause some friction between the condoms that could actually cause more breakage and leakage so we like to let everyone know especially teens to keep it simple just use one condom each and every time you have sex viruses can get through some of the natural skin condoms so they do not protect against all sexually transmitted infections we recommend the latex  or polyurethane which tend to be more expensive but need to be used by people who have latex allergies it is important that teens recognize that the condom needs to be put on as soon as there is an erection not waiting until there is been a little foreplay because there is ejaculate that can be released that can cause both stds and unplanned pregnancies even though it is so important to use a condom consistently and correctly many teens do not know how health care providers teen clinics and educational materials can provide information on how to use a condom properly

what is the difference between a class 1 and class 2 narcotic,the amount of sleep that a child needs is going to be based on that child is age actually we have a great article on webmd where you can actually click on the different ages to find out what your child is sleep need is going to be but generally speaking what we are finding in national sleep foundation is polls is that kids are not getting enough sleep and they are also not getting sleep at the times that they need it may be an enjoyable thing to because you are coming home late to be able to spend some time with your child and have them stay up past their bedtime but it really can be a detriment to their health in the long run in the first year of life children are going to sleeping north of 18 hours in some cases maybe as little as 12 or 13 hours but that oftentimes occurs if you have a very colicky baby or a reflux baby try to know and understand what health issues could be going on there when you get into the 2 to 3 range that is when your children should be sleeping about 11 – 12 hours then when you start to move into grade school you are going to be looking at 9 to 10 hours and you should your kids should stick to the 9 to 10 hour range almost through high school very few high schoolers get that much sleep and so interestingly what we have found is first of all high school age children tend to swing and want to stay up late and sleep late and so anybody out there who has a high school age kid knows that the kids want to stay up til 200 am and then they want to sleep til noon uh that is a natural occurrence for them believe it or not in minnesota they actually changed school start times and they found that kids increased their grades by almost a full letter grade by actually going to school later and staying later so when you are talking with your children about sleep one of the things that you want to say is hey this is very important for you first of all it helps you learn second of all it helps your overall mood and finally it really helps your health and so i try to make the importance of sleep greater for children so that way they can get an understanding of it it is not that mom or dad wants you to go to bed at a certain time because they are mean it is because they are actually doing something better for your health

i had sudden 15 min extreme blurred vision after being out in the cold for 40 min and fasting 36 h likely ive diabetes  28 y m 134 lb up 1 from last sun 2 3 from 2 wks before then 58 5 dad is type 2 diabetic,normal 0 false false false microsoftinternetexplorer4 hopefully you have started the anti yeast creams monistat lotrimin micatin etc or a store brand generic by now this will manage the yeast in a few days but you will still have inflammation a trick that i use for my little patients is to mix the yeast medication with an equal amount of hydrocortisone cream to help the redness and inflammation put in on the diaper area at least 3 4 times per day once this medication is rubbed in put a barrier cream or ointment over the top    something like plain ol vaseline air out the diaper area as much as you can after a bowel movement you may need to put the in the bathtub or shower to make sure you get off all of the stool residual this can burn the skin bad diaper rashes can also predispose the child to a secondary bacterial infection so if the skin is breaking down or bleeding you will need to contact her medical provider to see if an oral antibiotic would be appropriate aw i am sorry your baby is going through this uncomfortable is right i am not sure why you believe this diaper rash has turned to a yeast infection but i bow to your wisdom as the parent smile i do not have a lot to offer but i can tell you that regular old cornstarch available at the grocery store near the flour can help dry out the rash and it is safe even for baby girls with all those delicate skin folds in fact since it does not contain perfume it is a good choice for diaper rash in little girls if it is possible to dry out your baby is bottom by leaving the diaper off altogether for periods of time that is helpful too whatever you do please do not use any over the counter otc yeast infection medications on your baby she may be uncomfortable but she will survive until you get a diagnosis from a health care professional i hope this helps a little bit

can facial creams cause impetigo in young adults,this is a great question botox is one of my favorite treatments because it is the safest treatment that is minimally or noninvasive that has such reliable and dramatic results that look really natural but there is a finesse to it what is so great about botox for the face is that facial expressions happen because the muscles of your face are attached to your skin on your hands and your elbows they are attached to tendons or bone but in your face in order to create expression the muscles are actually within the skin so when you move the muscles move and that creates the expression by specifically placing botox where we want where we need in order to soften that expression you can have a very natural movement it is not a frozen look at all it is a very natural softer movement that can create balance and symmetry in the face that looks incredibly natural so you look so much better and everyone will notice that but nobody will know why

how hard is it to get my insurance provider to cover a breast reduction  i am 22 years old about 59 and 180lbs with a 38g cup size i am in horrible pain and do not know how to go about getting one or how to get my insurance to approve it,the bottom line when it comes to having insurance pay for any procedure is whether it is considered medically necessary in the case of a reconstructive procedure like the one you are asking about that generally means it is needed to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it sounds like for you breast reduction surgery may be medically needed whereas for another woman it could be considered a cosmetic procedure circumstances matter i would start the process by getting in touch with your insurer to find out what is needed to get the surgery covered you are likely to need your plan is pre authorization that will also mean getting your doctor to submit specific information about your circumstance and why heshe believes the surgery is medically needed insurers often have very specific requirements in order to approve such a surgery so it will be important for both you and your doctor to learn what they are and then to follow your plan is rules to submit the necessary paper work and justification for the procedure if you are initially denied be aware that you do have the right to appeal your insurer is decision and you should do not take no for an answer without fighting for the care you need appeals do often turn in favor of the patient best of luck

im 19 my penis is under 5inch when erect is this normal help i am scared to have sexual intercourse,i am sorry to hear you are feeling anxious about your penis size and how it might affect your sexual performance and i want to assure you your feelings are perfectly normal i think all men go through a period of insecurity regarding their penis size society puts a lot of emphasis on this particular aspect of masculinity  after all i hasten to assure you that your penis probably is perfectly normal in size but your best bet to completely set your mind at ease about the situation is to make an appointment with a urologist he or she can examine you and tell you if everything is ok also you may be surprised to learn that medically speaking penis size is not measured based on the erect organ rather penis size is measured by stretched penis length  the article i linked above will give you a lot of information about average penis length how to measure your penis and when to see a doctor i hope this helps set your mind at ease do not worry about it the average penis in america is 6 inches i to am not well endowed but my wife love mine she says it is just right and does not hurt her you are probably going by the magazines and movies trust me they are not normal sized we are created individually and when you find mrs right she will not care there are excersizes that will enlarge thickness and length they do work it is a slow process but it can be done also some of the enlargement drugs that is on the market do enlarge by increasing the blood flow and amount that the penis will tolerate again its a slow process but it is possible there are also excersizes to allow you to last for very long time before you climax that really turns your mate on also with time you will learn to satisify the woman and not yourself if you strive to satisify your mate she will hold on for life and do the same for you if you are lucky enough to find a virgin to marry someday god will match you perfectly

had oral sex 5 years ago didnt take test until two weeks ago from oraquick and it said negative can i move on,i am sorry you are going through this it sounds very distressing the only decent advice i can give you is to see a counselor or psychotherapist who has experience treating sexual issues i applaud your commitment to your girlfriend not to cheat on her but i also hasten to reassure you masturbation is normal i also recognize some religions frown on self pleasure so if this is an issue to you i again suggest you see a counselor you also could make an appointment with your primary health care provider to discuss this issue it is possible there is some type of medication that can be given to reduce the male sex drive i am not aware of what this might be again i think you are being very noble by honoring your girlfriend you also deserve to have your needs met however and for that reason i hope you seek out a therapist who can help you sort through this wishing you all the best
am i pregnant i have not had my period since november and when i take a pregnancy test it comes back negative but i have all the symptoms,hi i am a mother but not a medical professional fair warning what time of day did you take the test the test is looking for progesterone that is the hormone that your body secretes and then disposes of in urine that indicates you are pregnant and stop regular menstruation to allow for the pregnancy progesterone levels in urine are the highest first thing in the morning when you have had all night long for the urine to sit in your bladder and be inundated with the hormone when i became pregnant the tests i took in the middle of the night a month into the pregnancy were showing negative results while first relief in the morning was coming up positive consider trying a test first thing in the morning and if that still does not come up positive it does not mean you are not pregnant it is possible and common actually that you are just not excreting as much progesterone as the test requires to show a positive result if you are pregnant you are going to have to see a doctor anyway so you can even skip this and just make an appointment it will save you the money for the test and it will certainly calm your nerves if you are concerned
is the reason why i can not lose weight and keep it off because of my family history of obesity  i am a 19 year old female i have 1 child who is 14 months old at one point after my child was born i was exercising 5 times a day and on a strict diet plan for 4 months i only lost 15lbs during this time after that 4 months i was only able to work out once a day and still on the same diet i gained half the weight back my family is anywhere between 200 and 400lbs please help before it gets worse i currently weigh 220lbs,as a red blooded adult who has lost and gained 30 over 4 times and has struggles his whole life with weight problems i can see where you are coming from i am not sure if i can help you but i can tell you is the story of how i lost and kept off 50 pounds what i did that really helped my out was going to a doctor and asking him how many calories i should be eating a day with moderate exorcise walking 3 miles the doctor placed me at around 1400 2000 calories on average i consumed over 1350 calories a day none of those calories came from junk food i completely cut that out of my life in the mornings i would grab my dog and go for a brisk or casual walk around my local nature trail after i got come i would drink as much water as i wanted water helps a lot when losing weight believe it or not the most helpful thing i did when losing weight was eating right no junk food and moderate exorcise if every healthy person followed this healthy life style they will lose weight no exceptions period there are no excuses for a healthy person to not be losing weight i hope you the best of luck

i had sex and took my birth control 4 hours late it was my boyfriends and mines first time having sex and we used a condom but after when he pulled out there was a white fluid around the vagina was the semen or a female fluid if its semen could i get pregnant from it if i am on birth control we did look at the condom and it was not broken the white fluid just seemed to be around the vagina,i have lung problems myself and i found that i have nodules on my lungs and i also spit up a lot of phlem and i also have a pulmonary doctor that told me that i had bronchitis and emphysema my nodules are not very big now but he will recheck them in 6 months ask your doctor if you do not get to feeling better for a ct scan which will show more than an x ray the scarring could be from air pollution or pneumonia or emphysema or bronchitis or smoking even if you have been around someone who has smoked all of their lives and you have inhaled a great deal of that smoke you will feel the effects after so long a time my doctor put me on allbuterol it is a spray that i use whenever i feel like i can not breathe i am also taking symbicort which is also a spray that i use for asthma related cough also maintenance treatment for my copd it has helped me but i do not know if you could benefit that is why i said you should have a ct scan of your lungs so that your doctor can really see how bad your lungs really is and if you are short of breathe and sprays do not help i would suggest going to a cardiologist because anytime someone has a problem with shortness of breathe its either the lungs or the heart maybe both but i do suggest you go back to your doctor and ask for a ct scan or see if he will prescribe the allbuterol or symbicort to see if they will help but i will not you to look up the side effects of any medicine that he gives you only you will know if it is best for you to take and do not take it just because it helped me take it only if you decide that you trust your doctor and if it is best for you to take please let us know how you are doing and i would like to know how you are feeling please keep us informed of your status i do hope that you get to feeling better thank you
after surgery i am still bloated pressure acid reflux and now constipation what gives  i never had the pain associated but vomited everything i ate went from 230lbs to now 177lbs lost all first 3 months but went a year before surgery for lack of insurance during that year began to have frequent fevers and sores resembling pimples without heads on my underarms thigh area and chest closer to the nipple areas i feel this is all linked and afraid of more than just gallstones maybe more with digestive system please help becoming concerned and afraid of doctors,the sequence of events here is a little unclear to me it sounds like you had your gallbladder removed recently and also have other symptoms that sound unrelated to your gallbladder problem if you had your gallbladder removed recently and you have three or four small incisions including one in your belly button then you had laparoscopic surgery during this procedure several small incisions are made in your abdomen and instruments are inserted through them to make this process work your abdomen is inflated with harmless carbon dioxide gas the unfortunate side effect of this gas is post surgery bloating and sometimes pain at times the pain can occur in the shoulder area this is normal and should go away within several days vomiting after gallbladder surgery also is not uncommon if you follow a lower fat diet it should help with the vomiting issue if you had gallbladder surgery recently you should be scheduled for follow up appointments with your surgeon please keep these appointments your surgeon will be able to tell you if your recovery is progressing normally the pimples and sores in your underarm thigh and nipple area do not sound like they are related to your gallbladder issues digestive system issues usually do not manifest as skin problems i would suggest you consult a dermatologist or even your primary care physician to take a look at these lesions to find out what they are and what is causing them i hope this helps and wish you all the best

i had yearly pap yesterday doctor says discharge may be yeasty frightened it is cervical cancer,it started a few years ago when there was a flu shot shortage no flu shot for me that year i thought to myself “i do not want the miserable flu what can i do ” that is when i became a bathroom contortionist i knew that if i got the flu i was likely to give it to myself you do not usually get the flu from someone else you give it to yourself while someone coughing or sneezing in your face could certainly do it thankfully that does not happen very often you are more likely to get the flu from yourself you touch something that someone with the flu has touched then you touch your nose or mouth and you are infected flu viruses can live on surfaces for several hours – up to 24 hours on hard nonporous surfaces  you need to take steps not to infect yourself since not touching your nose and mouth is very difficult the best approach is to keep those hands clean here is my bathroom contortionist routine first i wash my hands and no just getting your hands wet does not count in order to get those clingy flu viruses off your hands you need to wash with soap and water rubbing your hands together vigorously ideally for at least 20 seconds but if you are going to skimp on the time do not skimp on the scrubbing the dirty truth about hand washing here is where so many people go wrong even if you get your hands good and clean the key is to not dirty your hands again even before making your way out of the bathroom you have to figure out how to get a towel to dry your hands without touching anything but that towel this might take some preparation make sure the towel is already available before washing your hands or break out the contortionist in you use your elbow to get the paper towel out of the dispenser since it is tough to get your elbow to your nose to infect yourself that way it is a pretty safe approach now to the faucet hopefully the faucet turned itself off if not hopefully you did not turn it off with your hands if so start all over because a team of germs just jumped back on board turn the faucet off with the paper towel from this point forward the towel is your hand on your way out the door push the door open with something other than your hand your butt elbow foot – pick your body part but i do not recommend your head or if you have to pull the handle to open the door just make sure only the towel touches the door then i open any other doors with the towel and then toss it in the trash when i get back to my office i am back in my office with squeaky clean germ free hands lastly

i was having dark and thickened spots in my finger skin for few months now it is started to crackle,gluten is a protein found in wheat and grain products people on a gluten free diet often avoid wheat rye and barley though there is also debate on whether to avoid oats as well a gluten free diet allows for fresh fruits vegetables meatpoultryfish and many dairy products unprocessed beans and nuts are also acceptable as well as products made with rice corn and soy if not buying fresh food it is important to always read food labels to look for foods specifically labeled as gluten free for example foods like cereal bread and lunch meat may or may not contain gluten so the only way to know for sure is to check the packaging the food industry can use gluten in many products that do not seem like they would contain gluten so it is important to always read the label first having a family history of food allergies could mean that your granddaughter may have a genetic predisposition to having food allergies as well it may be beneficial for her to try an elimination diet to identify any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that she may have the basic premise of this eating plan is to initially restrict eating to very basic foods and then to gradually reincorporate more foods the person doing this can then better discern which foods trigger a negative response when added back into their diet review this webmd article for more information on elimination diets and also consult with a doctor or registered dietitian before implementing drastic dietary changes well she has celiacs disease non life threatning disease but she can not have wheat so feed her corn based products like  some chex mix cerals corn tortillas some soups any thing that says gluten free on the label

why is it hard to predict when i ovulate,for years women have tried to accurately determine timing of ovulation in order to conceive or to avoid conception the interval of maximal fertility begins five wilcox 1995 to six days bigelow 2004 before ovulation and declines after ovulation occurs let is look at some popular do it yourself methods of determining ovulation calendar basal body temperature charting over the counter ovulation predictor kits calendar charting one is cycles on a calendar or using a string of colored beads “cycle beads” are low tech methods of attempting to predict one is “fertile time ” these methods of ovulation prediction tend to work best in women with very regular cycles between 26 32 days in length these methods are less exact at identifying the exact occurrence of an ovulation an improvement in accuracy can be accomplished if the woman is taught to identify changes in cervical secretions bigelow 2004 the lh surge and spike in estrogen levels precede ovulation by about 16 24 hours these hormonal peaks create the typical appearance of “fertile mucus” such as clear egg white consistency however recent intercourse or other sources of increased estrogen [e g polycystic ovarian syndrome] can mimic “fertile mucus ” basal body temperature charts just prior to ovulation there is a modest drop in baseline body temperature at ovulation and after the temperature rises about a half degree fahrenheit that ovulation has occurred is identified after the fact this is not as helpful for trying to conceive or prevent conception it does provide information about when the woman might ovulate in the following months however ovulation predictor kits perhaps the most reliable method to predict ovulation is to use an over the counter ovulation prediction kit opk these kits measure the amount of lh in a woman is urine when that level peaks one assumes that ovulation will follow within the next 24 36 hours there have been numerous research studies suggesting that the over the counter opks are very reliable when used according to package directions eichner 2004 one earlier study of five different opks ghazeeri 2000 was able to identify an almost two fold difference in sensitivity between the most and least sensitive kits this suggests that opk manufacturers should indicate the sensitivity of their product as many home pregnancy tests do one of the major difficulties with ovulation predictiondocumentation is “normal” cycle variations we suggest to women that it takes about 14 days after ovulation for the menstrual period to appear this interval is called the luteal phase yet a variety of studies have demonstrated the length of a luteal phase can range from 10 16 days even more varied is the interval from the first day of flow to day of ovulation follicular phase the mean length of the follicular phase can range from 15 16 5 days plusminus 2 6 to 3 5 days fehring 2006 therefore the variability between your cycle and that of your best girlfriend is is likely to be in the weeks that

how can i use sound to improve my sleep,so there is lots of sounds that can keep people awake but there is also sounds that can allow people to fall asleep let is talk about the awake sounds just for a moment if you look at the sounds that are going to wake people up they actually are different oftentimes by gender a perfect example of this would be the baby cry okay moms hear the babies barely cry dads sleep through baby cries what is interesting is it really depends on the dad we are not 100 convinced that dads actually sleep through the baby cry but they may pretend to sleep through the baby cry and so hoping that the mother will get up and and deal with the child because a lot of dads are not necessarily in that role in our house i can hear my kids cry almost before it gets out of their mouth and i am dashing across the house whereas my wife is absolutely out cold so it can vary quite a bit smoke alarm is one of the things that you will obviously that you are tuned in to hear to listen for when somebody breaks a window or you feel that somebody is breaking into the home those are types of sounds that you will hear another pretty disturbing bed sound could be your bed partner everything from snoring to gas to whatever it is can keep people awake interesting statistic they found that individuals that sleep next to someone who snores lose approximately one hour of sleep every night you sleep next to somebody that snores for 8 nights you have lost an entire night is worth of sleep that is a scary statistic but it is quite true so there is a lot of things that can have that effect what can we do to help ourselves with that believe it or not earplugs turn out to be a very good resource but you want to get your earplugs noise level rated in that you do not want the rating to be above 32 the reason being then you can not hear the baby cry or you can not hear the smoke alarm so and looking for those foamy earplugs that you can find almost anywhere actually turn about to be a very good option another thing we have found is that there is data to suggest that listening to ocean sounds will actually help people relax and fall asleep but a babbling brook or rain may make you want to go to the bathroom so you need to be pretty careful about the sounds that you are going to be hearing because some of them are going to have different reactions to you okay do i have a problem with people sleeping with music no but metallica is probably not the best to fall asleep to although there are probably plenty of people out there who can fall asleep to that you want music without

what is the recommended dose of folic acid while planning for pregnancy,i suggest you tablet folvite 5 mg of folic acid one tablet per day the recommended dose of folic acid is a controversial topic various doctors favor 1 mg to 5 mg per day the best part is that the folic acid has no side effects it is a water soluble vitamin and an excess of it gets excreted in urine so we recommend 5 mg per day to all our patients when sufficient dose is harmless there is no need to take a chance by giving low doses one more concern of mine is that you have to check with your neurologist if it is safe to go ahead with pregnancy while on lamictal lamotrigine the safety of lamictal is not established by studies but if your physician has good experience with personal case series then i think you can continue for further information consult a neurologist online   > <link>

could my period cause the feelings of depression and anxiety that i get at that time each month,it depends on the baby and it depends on the age the method of crying it out has been the most studied and it works for many babies but you should talk to your pediatrician about whether it is right for yours some babies get tired and go to sleep after crying but some just get angrier so where crying it out works for many babies it does not work for all of them there are some babies who just need to wake up and feed and then they will go back to bed instead of denying the feeding and having the crying it is best to feed them generally after four months or so you will find that the baby probably will not need to eat as much at night so if they are waking up and crying and falling asleep as soon as they get the breast or bottle you will know they are not hungry but if they are waking and ravenously finishing the breast or bottle they still need to be fed at night a rule of thumb if it is been one or two hours since you put them to bed they probably do not need to be fed but if it is been more than three or four hours they probably are hungry

the left side of my chest has hurt since childhood but at 17 it has gotten worse should i have more cardiac tests,the intensity and location of the blood limitation to the brain will determine what symptoms will be present as a result of a stroke or transient ischemic attack many people present with confusion weakness and lethargy if the loss of blood supply is in an area supplied by the carotid arteries a classic presentation may include weakness or paralysis and numbness of one side of the body the whole side may be affected or just one limb often there is a facial droop if the stroke is on the left side of the body where the speech centers are located there may be difficulty understanding words or speaking partial vision loss may also be part of the constellation of symptoms strokes involving the vertebral arteries decrease blood supply to the base of the brain and may cause a drop attack a sudden fall while walking or standing and then a quick recovery an unexpected collapse incoordination or difficulty walking the important distinction between stroke and tia is resolution of the symptoms by definition the symptoms of a tia must completely resolve and while this most often occurs within the first few minutes after symptom onset it may take up to 24 hours to have complete return to normal a special type of tia is amaurosis fugax transient blindness in one eye occurs because debris from a narrowed carotid artery clogs the artery ophthalmic artery that supplies blood to the back of the eye

what is chlamydia,viral infections that lead to sinusitis may be contagious bacterial sinusitis is generally not it is important to remember that most viral upper respiratory infections common colds cause nasal congestion which may involve the sinuses if the viral sinus infection lasts well past the normal duration of a cold viral sinusitis may be diagnosed these viruses are highly contagious and likely to cause a cold in others who come in contact with them bacterial sinusitis most often occurs as a complication of a viral common cold bacteria that are normally present in the nose and throat take advantage of the viral infection to invade the inflamed sinus passages these sinusitis causing bacteria may be passed from person to person but will not cause an infection unless the right conditions are present unlike with cold viruses most people will not develop sinusitis even if they are exposed to the bacteria
can i lose weight without exercising  if u may please tell me how and how long i am looking at 10 15 pounds,yes just stop eating weight loss occurs when your body takes in less than it needs how fast you lose that 10 15 pounds depends on many factors including how much you weigh right now a pound of fat is 3 500 calories so if you ate 1000 less calories a day than you need to maintain your ideal weight about 15 calories per pound of ideal weight you will lose about two pounds a week 8 pounds a month in about 6 weeks you can safely reach your goal you can lose it faster or slower but when you exercise you can reshape and look like you lost more yes definitely you can lose fat with exercise start following slow carb diet as i did with out exercise this diet is little strict but you can definitely follow it and get the best results it will change your habits all together below are few rules you can follow #1 avoid “white” carbohydrates #2 eat the same few meals over and over again #3 do not drink calories #4 do not eat fruits #5 take one day off per week
i have vomited every night shift in a strange way starting to accept this vomiting as normal,the quick answer to your question is yes your family members can take mucinex with tamiflu oseltamivir assuming none of them are allergic to the active ingredient in mucinex which is guaifenesin i am sorry to hear you have influenza raging through your family that is awful it is important to note that oseltamivir does not exactly cure the flu in fact in studies it only shortened the course of symptoms by about one day so your family members should not necessarily expect to feel better quickly when taking oseltamivir that said they should not stop taking the medication just because it does not seem effective yet they should take the whole course of oseltamivir which is usually given as one pill twice a day for five days meanwhile they should be ok to use other remedies such as acetaminophen tylenol ibuprofen motrin or over the counter cough and cold remedies to help them weather the symptoms of flu read labels carefully so you do not get overlapping drugs in various products for example do not mix two cough and cold remedies that both contain acetaminophen that is dangerous and do not overlook old fashioned chicken soup plenty of fluids and bed rest sometimes that is the only way to get over the flu if symptoms persist especially fever and congestion for more than five days it is probably a good idea to check back with the doctor if any adult spikes a high fever over 101f that is a good reason to take a trip to the emergency room next year flu shots for everyone prevention is always your best approach wishing you well

are baby carrots pre washed mini carrots you can get by the bag at the grocery store bad for you,baby carrots are not at all bad for you in fact they are quite the contrary actually there were concerns going around the internet that baby carrots were bad for you because they were rinsed in a solution that contains chlorine it is true that baby carrots as well as many other pre cut vegetables on the market are cleansed using a solution that contains water and chlorine but this is to help prevent food borne bacteria like e coli and salmonella the baby carrots are rinsed again with potable water afterwards to reduce any trace of the chlorine it is important to know that the chlorine is used in amounts much lower than what the fda allows also rinsing the baby carrots at home would not make a difference because even your tap water has chlorine in it too there were also rumors around the internet that a white film that you may see develop on the baby carrot is chlorine rising to the surface but it is merely just a result of dehydration the bottom line is that baby carrots are safe to eat are low in calories and are a great source of nutrients like vitamin a and fiber so they can be part of an overall healthy eating plan no these are fine to eat they taste pretty good too
week ahead on birth control pills what to do  my girlfriend is getting to her time of the month pills a week before she should be she does not know how it happened but it is like she lost a week of the blue pills somewhere what should she do,my first bit of advice is to you my young man be sure to use a condom birth control pills are not nearly as effective if they are not taken correctly you both may be at risk right now of her being pregnant so if her period does not start on time she probably will want to take a home pregnancy test meanwhile your girlfriend should start the new pack on the correct date as if she had not gotten off track she will need to take her pills correctly for at least 30 days in order to be confident she is protected against pregnancy for more information your girlfriend can consult her pharmacist or the medical professional who prescribed the pills also my general public service announcement always remember birth control is not the responsibility of just one person in a relationship even if the woman takes birth control pills it is a good idea for the man to use a condom this helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and adds protection against unwanted pregnancy likewise for girls even if a guy volunteers to use a condom you need to use some kind of birth control yourself if you want to avoid pregnancy do not rely on just one method take care

ear infection with leakage and fever my 10 yr old has an ear infection with fluid leaking from his ear and 102 temperature he has an ent and we have been putting in ciprodex drops in his ear for the past 2 days the fever went away for a couple of days but now it is back in full force the leakage has not stopped 48 hours and is pretty heavy at times how long will the leaking last and should i be worried that the fever is back it is saturday evening and his ent will not be back until monday should i take him to the er,otorrhea fluid leaking from the ear is most likely from a ruptured eardrum not as serious as it sounds but of course this is just a guess since i have no way of examining him the ciprodex should help but many medical providers would also use an appropriate oral antibiotic there is absolutely no way to determine even if i could examine him the duration of this drainage it will stop as the rupture heals fever rarely concerns me it is just the body is way of fighting the infection fever alone is not an indication to rush the er so if your child is comfortable just wait until monday and speak with the ent of course you know your son the best so use your best judgment in this case
how does high cholesterol cause heart disease,when there is too much cholesterol in your blood it builds up in the walls of your arteries over time this buildup causes the arteries to harden    a process called atherosclerosis the arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart muscle is slowed down or blocked the blood carries oxygen to the heart and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach your heart you may suffer chest pain if the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a sudden blockage the result is a heart attack there are two forms of cholesterol that most americans are familiar with low density lipoprotein ldl or bad cholesterol and high density lipoprotein hdl or good cholesterol these are the forms in which cholesterol travels in the blood ldls have little protein and high levels of cholesterol and hdl has a lot of protein and very little cholesterol ldl is the main source of artery clogging plaque hdl actually works to clear cholesterol from the blood triglycerides are another fat in our bloodstream research is now showing that high levels of triglycerides are also linked to heart disease

as a teen what time of day should i exercise,there are several ways to approach the evaluation and management of acid reflux also called gerd the approach depends primarily on the frequency and severity of symptoms the adequacy of the response to treatment and the presence of complications for infrequent heartburn the most common symptom of gerd lifestyle changes and an occasional antacid may be all that is necessary if heartburn is frequent daily nonprescription strength over the counter h2 antagonists may be necessary a foam barrier also can be used with the antacid or h2 antagonist if lifestyle changes and antacids nonprescription h2 antagonists and a foam barrier do not adequately relieve heartburn it is time to see a physician for further evaluation and to consider prescription strength drugs the evaluation by the physician should include an assessment for possible complications of gerd based on the presence of such symptoms or findings as cough asthma hoarseness sore throat difficulty swallowing unexplained lung infections anemia due to bleeding from esophageal inflammation or ulceration clues to the presence of diseases that may mimic gerd such as gastric or duodenal ulcers and esophageal motility disorders should be sought if there are no symptoms or signs of complications and no suspicion of other diseases a therapeutic trial of acid suppression with h2 antagonists often is used if h2 antagonists are not adequately effective a second trial with the more potent ppis can be given if treatment relieves the symptoms completely no further evaluation may be necessary and the effective drug the h2 antagonist or ppi is continued if at the time of evaluation there are symptoms or signs that suggest complicated gerd or a disease other than gerd or if the relief of symptoms with h2 antagonists or ppis is not satisfactory a further evaluation by endoscopy egd definitely should be done there are several possible results of endoscopy and each requires a different approach to treatment if the esophagus is normal and no other diseases are found the goal of treatment simply is to relieve symptoms if damage to the esophagus esophagitis or ulceration is found the goal of treatment is healing the damage if complications of gerd such as stricture or barrett is esophagus are found treatment with ppis also is more appropriate however the adequacy of the ppi treatment probably should be evaluated with a 24 hour ph study during treatment with the ppi strictures may also need to be treated by endoscopic dilatation widening of the esophageal narrowing if symptoms of gerd do not respond to maximum doses of ppi there are two options for management the first is to perform 24 hour ph testing to determine whether the ppi is ineffective or if a disease other than gerd is likely to be present if the ppi is ineffective a higher dose of ppi may be tried the second option is to go ahead without 24 hour ph testing and to increase the dose of ppi another alternative is to add another drug to the ppi that works

should i pay for a cosmetic surgery consultation,i think you get what you pay for in life and you get what you pay for in cosmetic surgeon is office a consultation i do not think a free consultation is a good idea first of all it implies that you do not think it is worth paying for in other words if the patient does not want to pay for service the patient should want to pay for service it is very important service because the answer may be that it is not a good idea to have cosmetic surgery for x y and z reasons and you are going to get an honest opinion because you are paying for the doctor is time otherwise often it is kind of like a little bit of a come on frankly in some practices particularly practices that are high marketing high advertising more of a clinic different atmosphere than other practices it makes it attractive to patients that say oh yeah it is free what do i have to lose but often they come in and then they are taken down a little road that they may not want to go to because sometimes there is some pretty sophisticated marketing by the way some of these clinics are owned by businessmen doctors are employees they just see this as another business and they hire a doctor just like a factory hires a line worker so often it is kind of a it is a little bit unclear hang on a second… it is an opening into what turns out to be too much of a slick operation medical consultation should be professional and it should not be a hustle it should not be slick and you should not feel pressured and sometimes people are because frankly if everyone came in and consulted at no charge how could the clinic stay in business if it did not do surgery now it is now likely certainly a fair percentage need something but i think it is healthier to pay for it and frankly for many practices that 200 or 150 or whatever the number is they apply it to the procedure anyway if you are comfortable or the doctor is comfortable doing it so at least in that practice it really has not cost you any more to consult if you are going to do consulting with 3 or 4 practices yes you could say wow 150 or 200 i am going to be investing a fair amount of money but you know you are also talking about a procedure that may be is thousands of dollars they are thousands most of the time certainly the bigger procedures like face lifting breast reduction tummy tucks it is still a good investment because you are going to learn in my experience the practices that charge you for the consultation give you a lot more education the practices that do not charge you give you a lot more selling but i do not think

how can my “attitude” about my bedroom affect my sleep,the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you did not include i will try to give you some general guidance in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug you can not obtain it without a prescription so i am wondering if you mean you took someone else is prescription medicine which is always a bad idea or if you obtained some sort of natural supplement type product that claims to contain levothyroxine or a related product dessicated pork thyroid levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions people who have had their thyroid gland removed or destroyed with radioactive iodine or who do not produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine no one should take levothyroxine or any other thyroid hormone unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions so in short taking a single 50mcg dose of levothyroxine on a one time basis probably is no cause for alarm but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider hope this helps it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me i took the medication then realized it was not mine pharmacy put someone elses in the bag i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary thanks for information

what is hypothyroidism,in the united states approximately 200 000 people contract hbv [hepatitis b virus] each year however only 10 000 to 15 000 of these people develop a chronic hepatitis b infection why do some people clear the virus from their bodies while others progress to chronic disease it appears that the immune system is the most important factor in determining whether a person can rid herself of this virus rather than develop a persistent infection the immune system is relatively immature early in life therefore the younger a person is when hbv is contracted the greater the likelihood that the infected person will become a chronic carrier of the disease if an adult is infected her probability of developing chronic disease is very low—approximately 1 to 5 percent if a person contracts the infection in infancy there is as much as a 90  to 95 percent chance that her immune system will be unable to eliminate this virus from her body children fall somewhere in between having approximately a 25 to 35 percent chance of going on to chronic disease men are six times more likely than women to become chronic carriers of hbv the reason for this has not been determined also people with poor immune systems—such as those infected with hiv organ recipients and those undergoing chemotherapy—have a much lower success rate of eliminating the virus from their bodies patients who are the sickest during their acute illness especially those who develop jaundice or who survive fulminant hepatitis have the highest likelihood of totally recovering and thus not progressing to a chronic disease

i understand that i can get less expensive health insurance coverage than i now have but does not that also mean the benefits will not be as good,let me answer your question generally and then let me suggest that you go on the website and really look at what your actual factual options are so that you can determine what you have to pay and what coverage is available first in many states consumers may find premiums that are lower than they would have paid before health care reform this is particularly true for those with lower incomes who are eligible for subsidies including tax credits however in some cases the coverage available to you may be more expensive rather than less as far as benefits go as a general rule they should be better than those in the individual insurance market before the law was enacted for example plans are now required to cover more preventive screenings and a list of government guaranteed benefits including maternity coverage however you may face higher cost sharing than under a previous plan so again let me emphasize the importance for all consumers of really getting on the website and checking out and comparing your options keep in mind that under the aca people can afford preventive screenings   thus finding out what they are sick with   but often can not afford the treatment pay special attention to how much your deductible is because often when you have a lower premium it comes with a really high deductible a high deductible often 3 6 thousand dollars means you will be paying full cost for most medications and procedures before you meet that amount so read your options carefully and ask lots of questions

can you get mono twice,yes you can but very few people do mononucleosis is usually caused by the epstein barr virus ebv symptoms usually include fever swollen and painful tonsils and enlarged lymph nodes fatigue and low energy can last for weeks or months more than 90 of us eventually catch ebv usually during adolescence or early adulthood in many people the illness is mild and may never be diagnosed as mono infection by ebv generally results in lifelong immunity—you can only have ebv mono once there is also a less common form of mononucleosis caused by infection by cytomegalovirus cmv in one study of people with mono about one out of seven had mono caused by cmv the rest had typical ebv mononucleosis catching and recovering from ebv mono offers no protection against cmv mono and vice versa few people get mono from cmv most people are infected with cmv at some point in life and experience only mild short lived symptoms after that they are generally immune to cmv mono or other illnesses caused by cmv i have had mono three times all three times were medically confirmed by a doctor upon analysis of a blood test i was shocked because i was under the impression you could not get it more than once i told the doctor that i had already had it once so if possibly that is what was showing up in my blood test she said they test for the active form and i 100 had it either i am a medical mystery or you can definitely get mono more than once even more than twice my daughter is 31 yrs old and has had mono confirmed 4 times the first time she was 15 and was just confirmed today for the 4th time we were told that it stays in your system forever and when you get stressed do not get enough sleep or if her immune system is low it will come back it is hard to get some people to understand that she can not run all the time like most 31 yr olds the doctor told her she is to just to go to work and rest as much as possible i tested positive for mono 8 or 9 years ago i am 49 years old and my blood test just came back the dr told me that i tested extremely positive for mono both times my only symptom has been extreme fatigue thought this stuff was for the youngsters i have had mono twice i am 18 and i am now just getting over the second time the first time i got mono i had chicken pox and mono and the second time i had mono strep and a absence in my right tonsil which makes your tonsil full of puss and blood and it constantly has to be drained both times i was in the hospital for up to five days so i am living proof that you can get mono and

what happens if i gain too much or too little during pregnancy,in the short term gaining the suggested amount of weight reduces the risk of preterm birth birth before 37 weeks of gestation and promotes a baby that is not too big or too small at delivery in the long run research suggests that the greater the weight gain during pregnancy the higher the risk of having an overweight child and one with higher blood pressure children who are born too small which can result from inadequate weight gain during pregnancy are more prone to certain chronic conditions including heart disease and diabetes during adulthood what if you miss the mark for recommended weight gain if you are off by just a few pounds either way it probably will not make much of a difference the iom institute of medicine guidelines provide a range in each bmi category suggesting that good outcomes are achieved with all different weight gains listen to the advice of your doctor or nurse midwife about weight gain but if you have doubts ask what is right for you
can i get herpes from sharing a pipe  so i just shared a pipe with a friend i suspect may have a cold sore on his lip it was a visible scab he claimed it was from hot oil on his face but lets assume it is herpes i would wipe off the tip of the glass pipe pretty good on my shirt and waited to hit it several seconds after passed to me i am paranoid now i just got home and brushed my teeth and used listerine how likely is it i have herpes now,herpes simplex virus can be spread in that manner if this person had herpes and you were susceptible to getting it since many people have antibodies for herpes already from a past infection even from a child you may not be susceptible if you are then keep in mind that not all exposed people will get it if you were exposed only time will tell herpes can take several weeks to a few months after exposure before you may see an herpetic break out sadly brushing your teeth using listerine and wiping off that pipe beforehand did not lower your risk

does ferrous gluconate in my multi vitamin help iron deficiency anemia  i also take ferrous sulfate for my anemia i have been on them for years and wanna figure out if i can stop taking one or the other safely,you need to address this issue with your medical provider   someone who knows your hemoglobin and serum iron levels ferrous gluconate does offer some available iron just like ferrous sulfate but i do not know the milligrams in either one of those or if the dosage is appropriate for your level of iron deficiency anemia it is not just your iron dosage but your ability to bind this iron and use it iron binding capacity your doctor can check this by a blood test

other than always having benadryl with me what else can be done for my allergic reactions to insect stings,it depends on the location of the laceration and size and complexity of the repair but generally i like to take out the skin sutures in five days if the wound is healing well not infected and the laceration is not in a spot that is under tension they can remain in longer but scaring potential increases so many clinicians will remove them at five days and reinforece the wound repair with steri strips special adhesive strips for some additional healing time

my husband wants me to have oral sex will i get sick if he comes in my mouth i was physically and sexually abused as a child my husband knows about this he has asked if i would preform oral sex for him will i get sick if he comes in my mouth are there germs that can also make me sick when i was forced to do this as a child and my dad crammed his dick in my mouth and came i threw up and began to chock i was also afraid that i would get pg,p { margin bottom 0 08in }alink { } p { margin bottom 0 08in }alink { } semen is not be a problem if he is disease free however that being said swallowing semen is probably not as widespread as some would like you to think i know that my wife does not like it and i do not force her to do it   that is nothing for her to be ashamed of during oral sex she swallows all the pre ejaculate clear fluid with no problem occasionally when i kegel a heavy burst of pre ejaculate will flow out and sometimes she will have to back off a little to swallow it but the few times she has attempted to swallow semen has resulted in gagging – there is just too much thick fluid being introduced into the back of the throat to handle at one time when the penis is inserted 2 3 inches or more   unless you are really prepared for it i know when i am about to come and   unless your husband has premature ejaculation issues he does too in 40 years of receiving oral sex i have only slipped up and started to ejaculate in her mouth probably less than 5 times i tell her when i am ready to go she pulls off and finishes me up with her hand practice makes perfect if you have a problem with the pre ejaculate simply use a snug fitting steel cock ring at the base of the penis to block the flow until such time as you think you are ready for it i start with a cock ring occasionally for the extra engorgement sensation but i do not use it for the entire process because i am rather slow to come 40+ minutes and the lack of blood flow through the penis for that period of time would be an issue for me if your husband comes fast he could probably wear it all the way through to orgasm and it will prevent semen from exiting the penis ejaculation while wearing the ring could possibly cause some pain for him though   i ejaculated while wearing one a couple times and it caused some pain in my testicles he could try it in order to know for sure the pain in not unbearable and it will go away additionally remember that there is nothing dirty about oral sex between a man and his wife there are various techniques and tricks that my wife performs on me that make the experience absolutely incredible the term variety is the spice of life can be applied to oral sex as well biting and sucking the penis open mouth breathing with penis inserted licking the frenulum while sucking going deep then pulling off slowly allowing the penis to slip through your teeth gripping the penis with your hand while sucking rubbing his nipples while sucking and holding ice cubes or

if someone is exposed to someone with shingles can that person become a carrier of the shingles virus  my father has recently been exposed to someone that has been diagnosed with having shingles since i have had shingles once already i would like to know if i should stay away from him if he is a carrier of the virus if he is a carrier how long should i stay away from him,shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox shingles itself is not contagious what i mean is you cannot get shingles from someone else who has shingles shingles is contagious from the standpoint that you can get chickenpox from direct exposure to shingles blisters in other words if a person has never had chickenpox and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox that person can get chickenpox if they come in contact with shingles blisters however if you have had chickenpox or shingles you cannot get shingles from coming in contact with someone who is having an active outbreak of shingles a shingles outbreak is triggered from within your own body it is not caused by contact with someone else so to answer your question you do not need to avoid contact with your dad you also should be aware that you can get the shingles vaccination if you are over age 50 even if you have had an outbreak of shingles in the past i hope this helps i know a man who told me his wife died from shingles i think he is a carrier even though he does not have the symptoms because after cleaning his house for him and spending a few hours talking with him and using his dishes i developed a single shingle on my hand and two on the top of my upper lip now i have never had herpes or fever blisters or cold sores ever my family members were afflicted but i never was infected i freaked out and treated the sores with a variety of things to get it to go away before it spread i used colloidal silver for one both topically and orally i used a baking soda paste i used essential oils oregano and peppermint i finally also used organic apple cider vinegar and the one on my hand has disappeared the ones on the lip were gone in four days the one on my hand had lasted two weeks i think you can catch it from someone my husband had it when i was pregnant with my son in 1984 and i never got it i have had chickenpox a mild case when i was a little one i think this is a nervous reaction in the body to stressors that one has not release from you can die from it it seems more serious to me than they make it out to be and it some cases it is contagious
can i be pregnant and still have my periods coming  had a miscarriage on jul17 had sex by jul31 spotted light bleeding aug13 17 then it stopped by sept 4 i started my period till sept 10 i had slight cramps on both sides of my lower abdomen between aug13  sept 4 but no pregnancy symptom lately and few days after my period i now have headaches indigestion bloating i cant lay on my stomach without feeling movements and i have to turn used home pregnancy tests all negative can i be pregnant before i had my period,first off congratulations on your weight loss i think you have a couple of choices right now you can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery in order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity it is best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program i do not know how much weight you have to lose the calories you have been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration i think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism you can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do i encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight you may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success and just because you are not losing weight now does not mean you will not be able to in the future good luck

i have been on depoprovera for 4 months for the last month i have been spotting often what could be happening,there are a variety of possible explanations for sudden onset spotting on depoprovera 1 new infection with chlamydia  this is less likely unless you have a new sexual partner or a partner with multiple other partners 2 stress  many women using hormonal birth control pillspatchesringshot have had an apparent correlation between life stress and spotting on their birth control method i have also seen this occur in a couple of my postmenopausal patients yet there are no good studies in the medical literature on this phenomenon if there is a connection between life stress and the adrenal gland hormones that can be converted to weak estrogens that might be a trigger for breakthrough bleeding 3 normal effects of the depoprovera shot on the lining of the uterus  simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer causes a thickening of the lining and progesterone is like the lawnmower keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms this is why depoprovera high dose synthetic progesterone brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills relatively progesterone dominant bring about shorter lighter periods if the lining of the uterus gets very thin it can prompt more breakthrough bleeding since it has been a month of constant spotting i would urge you to return to the gyn or clinic who administers your depoprovera they can check for infections if needed and can give you a more for sure answer about the spotting if someone is having very heavy breakthrough bleeding a short course of low dose estrogen pills can sometimes terminate the spotting

as a teen how can exercise affect my weight,because exercise helps use up oxygen it causes your body to burn stored fat and helps you maintain a normal weight for instance if you walk 4 miles a day four times a week you can burn about 1 600 calories or nearly half a pound a week if you do not change your diet at all and keep walking the same distance over six months you will lose 12 pounds walk the same distance for a year and you will drop 24 pounds the neat thing about exercise is you do not have to do it all at one time after all not many teens have time to walk 4 miles after school but you can do 4 miles in short bursts throughout your day here is an idea of how to work that much exercise into your daily regimen take a 1 mile walk on a treadmill before school then take a 1 mile walk around the track during school lunch period take a 1 mile walk after school with friends or the family dog take a 1 mile walk on the treadmill while watching your favorite show before dinner if you stay with the walking program you will see benefits with weight loss muscle strengthening and definition stronger bones a lower heart rate better mood an improved complexion
i am suffering from hypothyroidism and taking eltroxin and thyronorm but cholesterol is raising what to do,sorry to hear you are going through this it sounds like you did a great job of rehabbing on your own though the shoulder is a very complex structure if in fact you did injure your rotator cuff it can take a long time to heal aggravating the injury through usage can make the process slower however it is possible the problem is not your rotator cuff at all there are structures called  bursae  in the shoulder too these are leathery sacs of fluid that help lubricate the joint it is possible to tear or otherwise injure a bursa sac around the shoulder which can lead to the type of symptoms you are describing or you could have injured a ligament like i said the structure of the shoulder is very complex whether it is your rotator cuff a bursa or a ligament the main healing factor is time obviously something about the puck shooting motion and force is aggravating your injury which may increase your healing time if the pain becomes chronic or you feel you have re injured the shoulder then it is clearly time to have the doctor look at it again after all your great work rehabbing the injury you do not want to now undo everything hope this helps
why are you a fan of chemical instead of laser peels,when hbsab is positive antibodies are present  it usually means that you have recovered from a hepatitis b infection and have some immunity or that you once received the hepatitis b vaccination and are immune and negative antigen confirms that
just found out i have hepatitis c,let me answer your question generally and then let me suggest that you go on the website and really look at what your actual factual options are so that you can determine what you have to pay and what coverage is available first in many states consumers may find premiums that are lower than they would have paid before health care reform this is particularly true for those with lower incomes who are eligible for subsidies including tax credits however in some cases the coverage available to you may be more expensive rather than less as far as benefits go as a general rule they should be better than those in the individual insurance market before the law was enacted for example plans are now required to cover more preventive screenings and a list of government guaranteed benefits including maternity coverage however you may face higher cost sharing than under a previous plan so again let me emphasize the importance for all consumers of really getting on the website and checking out and comparing your options keep in mind that under the aca people can afford preventive screenings   thus finding out what they are sick with   but often can not afford the treatment pay special attention to how much your deductible is because often when you have a lower premium it comes with a really high deductible a high deductible often 3 6 thousand dollars means you will be paying full cost for most medications and procedures before you meet that amount so read your options carefully and ask lots of questions

how do my sleep habits affect my waking hours,kotler traveling for cosmetic surgery there is a fascinating subject the question is what are the risks of traveling 8 000 miles say to south africa or down to costa rica and having cosmetic surgery and is it a good deal well dollars and cents wise it is a good deal but remember you have to factor in the air fare and all those other issues but let is just say that the total expenditure is less and it may well be uhm it is not the craziest thing in the world frankly for some people and by some people i mean those who are a little more adventuresome here is why first of all you do combine it with a vacation but you better take the vacation part of it first because you do not want to be bouncing around on a safari truck after you have had your tummy tuck but secondly the real issue is what if there is a problem and who presides over the post operative care because you know the care of the patient does not end at the end of the operation or even a week or ten days later because after all there are wounds that have to mature sometimes they heal better in one person than another and who is going to preside over that so the issue is who is going to give the post operative care that is the best scenario problem but the worst scenario problem is what if i get a complication or infection and now i am 3 000 miles or 10 000 miles away from home it is costing me x amount of money because my health insurance does not even cover this medical problem that i have because i am in a foreign country i do not have any family here is that likely most of the time not frankly i will tell you that the south african surgeons are very good we have seen excellent work coming up from costa rica but we have also seen some very substandard work coming up from costa rica for example i could tell you the same thing about mexico i could tell you that i have seen people come back who have had very nice work done and we have had other people that walked into this office without an appointment having a massive abdominal infection because the doctor that operated on them across the border is gone is missing does not respond to phone calls and they walked into this building because they know we have a lot of cosmetic surgeons in this building and they need help so for those who are adventuresome who tend to worry less it is probably okay pick your country pick your doctor well the more advanced countries i think offer you a little more sophistication and safety the exchange rate is indeed very favorable with some other countries like south africa and quite frankly south africa has been

physical therapy exercises for a rotator cuff injury i have diagnosed myself with a rotator cuff injury i have been resting it for about 3 4 months now hoping it would start feeling better but it has not it does not bother me in most day to day activities mostly when showering when i reach for my other arm to wash it and i can not sleep very well on my right side i am wondering if someone could recommend some exercises i could do to strengthen my shoulder thanks,i have had bad rotator cuffs and frozen shoulders in both shoulders the docs had me do therapyshoulder exercises for 6 months before i had surgery for the first one and all i did was therapy for the other with no mri on the second although i also could only do therapy because of the cost of follow up on the second after my insurance changed maybe i had bad doctors and therapists but nobody ever told me that exercises would make it worse and everyone really pushed for 30 min to hour of exercise every day to every other day the exercisestherapy before and after my surgery performed both by myself and by professional therapists were very painful and except for a very short time immediately after my surgery the doctor and therapists never said to limit the exercises because of the pain or that the painful exercises were possibly causing harm although i would recommend some care obviously the exercises you find at reputable sites on the internet are typically the same that i was given to perform large wide bands rubber are used for most of the exercises for strengthening i have not looked for them in the store but they may be available   start with the least resistance you can get first then work up to stronger bands the exercises should be done slowly in both directions   do not use a band that is so strong you can not control the recoil and you should be able to do ten to fifteen repetitions other exercises can be done against a wall i am not a doctor or medical professional so i do not have to recommend seeing a doctor obviously it would be best to do so but i understand that decent health care is not affordable   even with insurance

my daughter cries after and sometimes while eating,first the vast majority of people who think they have the flu influenza do not and not all viral infections are the same non medical people often call any illness associated with fever or body aches as the flu children can spread influenza true lab diagnosed influenza for about a week several days longer than adults adults and children can also be contagious a day before they develop influenza tamiflu does reduce viral shedding if taking early in the first 2 days schools and day care facilities tend to make up their own rules often without any medical consultation allowing a child to return to school 24 hours after a fever has resolved is not a valid parameter for all illnesses including the flu children should return to school when they are well not just fever free <link>

my son is 15 @51 120lbs what can be done to help him grow i am 51 my husband is 59 we are concerned about his height and want to make sure there is nothing we should be doing i e is there a medical condition we should check in to  pituitary are there any vitaminsnutrients he should be taking etc although his voice has not changed yet there are some signs of puberty in progress  we want to give him any benefit that might be available or rather we do not want to overlook any possiblities,you son is not done growing by a long shot in fact his major growth spurt puberty has probably just started which is later than girls but lasts longer while girls are typically done growing around 16 18 years boys do not stop growing until 18 20 years of age two years later boys can grow up to 4 inches a year during this time muscle growth is dependent on increases in testosterone and the beginning of puberty and that can vary from child to child as for nutrition provide your son with regular meals and snacks and allow him to eat to his appetite include lean protein sources fruits vegetables whole grains low fat dairy and healthy fats and nutrition poor foods in moderation if he is erratic with his eating a multivitamin can help if you are concerned about his height or any underlying medical issues see his pediatrician but try not to make a big deal of it if everything is okay from a health standpoint he will grow the way nature intended he may just be a late bloomer

sick for 3+ weeks started with mild fever but turned into a cold which has grown progressively worse and will not go away  the main reason i am concerned is because there is a rattling in my chest when i breathe out it is like i can hear the fluid bubbling around deep in my chest when i cough up mucus it is yellow i do not have a fever day quil helps reduces the cough for a bit but not the stuffiness i have also been taking my allergy medicine my sleeping pattern is not very regular but i get at least 8 hours a night is this just a very prolonged cold or should i go to a doctor because of the rattling,imagine that you are exercising you are working up a sweat you are breathing hard your heart is thumping blood is coursing through your vessels to deliver oxygen to the muscles to keep you moving and you sustain the activity for more than just a few minutes that is aerobic exercise any activity that you can sustain for more than just a few minutes while your heart lungs and muscles work overtime the beginning it all starts with breathing the average healthy adult inhales and exhales about 7 to 8 liters of air per minute once you fill your lungs the oxygen in the air air contains approximately 20 oxygen is filtered through small branches of tubes called bronchioles until it reaches the alveoli the alveoli are tiny sacs they kind of look like bunches of grapes and you have about 300 000 000 in each lung  where oxygen diffuses enters into the blood from there it is a beeline direct to the heart getting to the heart of it the heart has four chambers that fill with blood and pump blood two atria and two ventricles and some very large and active coronary arteries because of all this action the heart needs a fresh supply of oxygen and as you just learned the lungs provide it once the heart uses what it needs it pumps the blood the oxygen and other nutrients out through the large left ventricle and through the circulatory system to all the organs muscles and tissue that need it a whole lot of pumping going on your heart beats approximately 60 80 times per minute at rest 100 000 times a day more than 30 million times per year and about 2 5 billion times in a 70 year lifetime every beat of your heart sends a volume of blood along with oxygen and many other life sustaining nutrients circulating through your body the average healthy adult heart pumps about 5 liters of blood per minute oxygen consumption and muscles all that oxygen being pumped by the blood is important you may be familiar with the term oxygen consumption  in science it is labeled vo 2 or volume of oxygen consumed it is the amount of oxygen the muscles extract or consume from the blood and it is expressed as mlkgminute milliliters per kilogram of body weight muscles are like engines that run on fuel just like an automobile that runs on fuel only our muscles use fat and carbohydrates instead of gasoline oxygen is a key player because once inside the muscle it is used to burn fat and carbohydrates for fuel to keep our engines running the more efficient our muscles are at consuming oxygen the more fuel we can burn the more fit we are and the longer we can exercise

how can i get rid of the fat pad in my groin area,in general we recommend people not take medications beyond their expiration date why because these medications may lose potency strength or they may otherwise degrade if active ingredients in the medication degrade they may not work as they should in the case of any specific medication like dexedrine you should consult your healthcare provider or a pharmacist these professionals can help you determine if it is safe or not to take the medication generally i would say it is not by the way it is also important to follow the storage instructions indicated on the medication package for example many medications need to be stored in a cool dry place  this is because heat can cause drugs to degrade rapidly if your medications have been exposed to temperatures over about 80 degrees fahrenheit for a prolonged period of time they may not work as expected the shelf life of medications goes down if they have been kept in high heat conditions this means they may expire even before the date printed on the label wishing you well
i had radiation therapy and chemotherapy for stage 4b2 cervical cancer is it possible my ovaries were not completely fried and i am ovulating again,no keflex will not interfere with lactation
some symptoms of pregnancy but one negative pregnancy test 5 days before missed period can i still be pregnant  my boyfriend and i decided to try and we basically had sex every other day during my fertileovulation days for the last week 12 i have had abdominal cramping like i am about to get my period bloating like you would not believe sleepy more often and my breasts have gotten fuller and a little sore i have no had any implantation bleeding i decided to take a pregnancy test about 4 5 days before my missed period but it turned out negative is it still possible that i could be pregnant,probably the most common cause of outer vaginal itching would be yeast yeast loves warm dark and moist places and the vagina really fits the requirements yeast is present in our environment so you do not have to catch it from someone it can just happen you may want to consider using one of the many over the counter vaginal yeast medications to see if it helps another possibility would be a contact dermatitis if you recently changed laundry detergents dryer softeners or soaps this could be a culprit as well if home treatments are not helping you will need to see your health care provider for a proper examination diagnosis and treatment

can herpes 2 go unnoticed on an std test  a year ago i had blood urinary and swab test only to find out i had herpes 1 and a yeast infection uti i am a male so it was all new to me after about a year or so i had developed sores under the head of my penis so i went and got a urineblood test done and was informed that i have herpes 2 so i am wondering if i could have had it this whole time and it did not show up before since there were no signs or if i did in fact recently receive the virus,epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness during a seizure neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second much faster than normal in some people this happens only occasionally for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day more than 2 million people in the united states    about 1 in 100    have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy for about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques however about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment many people with epilepsy have normal or above average intelligence famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure free by 20 years after their diagnosis the odds of becoming seizure free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery

does ringing in the ear cause the face to droop on one side  im basically healthy and had ringing in the ear about 2 yrs ago due to a viral infection from a cold i had a sore throat on the same side i took lipo flavonoid and afte time the ringing stopped i made the mistake and stopped taking it and receintly the ringing came back several days later the same side of my face drooped i am able to blink both eyes some watering occurs from that eye if wind hits it,you seem concerned by the swollen neck with pain and swelling behind the ears as well you have also made a mention of shooting pains in the head along with the feeling of dizziness and a suggested diagnosis of chickenpox older children teenagers and young adults are likely to have more severe cases of chicken pox than young children they usually have more sores run a temperature for longer and may experience some nausea initial symptoms of chicken pox are usually ignored one may have slight nasal congestion a loss in appetite or one may feel tired or run down these symptoms may occur for a day or two before other manifestations of chicken pox most children with chickenpox act sick with symptoms such as a fever headache tummy ache or loss of appetite for a day or two before breaking out in the classic pox rash the outcome is generally excellent in uncomplicated cases encephalitis pneumonia and other invasive bacterial infections are serious but rare complications of chickenpox in your son is case the second possibility is of measles which shall also be ruled out in consultation with your personal physician hope this helps take care note this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional

i want to know if the flu like symptoms i am experiencing are from the valacyclovir i was prescribed i was prescribed valacyclovir for treatment of hsv1 i had been taking 500mg twice daily for 4 days on day 4 i went on a 2 mile run i noticed that my lymph nodes in my neck were somewhat swollen and tender after sleeping for 6 hours i woke with flu symptoms tight neck headache congestion nausea fever chills etc i read online that these symptoms are also common side effects of the valacyclovir is it likely that the medication in combination with the run just brought on an actual flu,good news bad news the lhrh agonist lupron is one brand is critical to the success of prostate cancer treatment for many men and sounds like it was effective along with the brachytherapy in your husband is case the bad news is the potential for side effects in this case he needs a serum free and total testosterone level to determine if the level is still low for his age giving back testosterone in the form of shots or rub on gels could raise his t level but might increase the chance of a cancer recurrence discuss this with your doctor a lot would depend on the psa level should be very low and the digital rectal exam should have a very flat prostate with no nodules to allow the possibility of t replacement as far as the penis side effects he could get a prescription for a vacuum erection device ved to stretch and exercise his penis to try to restore the length and size the ved can also be used with other treatments for erectile dysfunction ed such as viagracialislevitra muse caverject etc he could see a urologist who specializes in treatments for ed for more details

what to expect after rotator cuff surgery i have also had each shoulder done right shoulder 12 yrs ago never gave me a problem until an injury at work so now i have to have it done again along with an open hand carpel tunnel also on my right i am in my late 40 is an i am scared of what to expect my left shoulder was done in 2012 and it still is not 100 how long i wonder will i be after these 2 surgeries or will i ever get back to 100,unfortunately there is really no way to predict a 100 success after a surgery i do not have the facts related to your tear or your medical history but rotator cuff surgeries can be tricky some people have wonderful outcomes others do not personally i have had two surgeries about six months apart on my left shoulder and it failed not wanting to have a third surgery i am currently just living with it like you my right shoulder is now causing me some pain i am older than you have a heart to hear talk with your surgeon while many will be very optimistic about your outcome even the best surgeons will never predict a 100 positive outcome as a patient you need to carefully weigh the pros and cons with your surgeon surgeons love to do surgery and they all claim they are the best but do not hesitate to get a second opinion asks lots of questions especially about the technique they will be using older surgeons often do old surgeries and may not offer you the latest technology younger surgeons may know the latest techniques for surgical repairs but may not have the experience in the end you are the one that must give the go ahead

is nocturia for a 21 year old male an alarming sign i have to wake up once every night to urinate sometimes there is pain in the perineum if urine is passed after ejaculation there is minimal fluid intake before bed time the nocturia has been persistent for almost a year but currently i have noticed some urgency on increased fluid intake if has been sitting for prolonged times in a specific position,nocturia one time per night is not alarming and should be considered normal the need to urinate depends on many factors including the amount of fluid intake in the hours before going to bed and of course your ability to completely empty your bladder when you do urinate age 21 is far to young for most prostate problems but you are not too young to acquire prostatitis an enlarge prostate due to an infection could cause issues with urination frequent night urination in a young healthy male could indicate diabetes you are not going frequently at night just once if diabetes runs in your family a simple glucose test would be in order what is nocturia in a 60 year old male
is it safe to take emergen c while pregnant,this is a great question because actually the two drugs mentioned wellbutrin and geodon actually can cause some weight gain so i would actually ask this patient number one are they telling their doctors that they    they may be seeing two different doctors are they aware that they are taking these medications and do they have a medication list because of the side effect profile we are adding a medication that we really probably do not need i would like to be able to find a more non drug option such as changing their diet increasing their fluid intake so we want to make sure that that patient understands that the pharmacist by looking at their medication list when they are coming to visit the pharmacy will be able to point that out and say hey you are getting an unnecessary medication for side effect of two drugs and maybe one of them they may not necessarily need so that is where the pharmacist can actually contact the physicians or healthcare provider and say doctor are you aware of this this happens all the time in the pharmacy i can not tell you how many times i say to patients does your doctor know well i went to this doctor for this medicine but this doctor does not know about this one everyone needs to know about it that is why that medication list is so important not only is it help the pharmacist but bring it to all your other doctor appointments that way they can see everything that everyone is prescribing and we can avoid medication errors and unnecessary use i also have been on sooo many anti depressants and other meds for bipolar ii and always gained weight i am a 40 year old woman who is 51 tall and at that time almost 150 pounds but i was just prescribed a very new anti depressant called fetzima there is not any generic version as of yet i am on the max dose at 80mg daily but add lamictal adderall xanax seroquel ambien xr propranolol imitrex injections cambia liquid spinx nasal spray and lastly phenergen 25mg prn migraine with vomiting but my point which i apologize for going off in so many directions thanks to the adderall 60mg daily the fetzima is supposedly much better as far as weight is concerned it actually lists that weight loss is more common than weight gain and while i would never suggest anyone to be on a stimulantadderall when i have never been addadhd i take it daily and in a pretty decent dosage to somehow get me to function thru the day it is hard to figure out as the patient why a doctor would put you on a lot of uppers and then you need downers it is crazy but with the adderall i have been on for almost 3 months and in all honestly i now weigh 103 pounds so over 45 plus pounds

who is at risk for viral hepatitis,recently i have been reviewing the subject of medical spas and in my files i found an interesting article published in plastic surgery practice several years ago the story was an expose of medical spas with very thin physician coverage the founder and executive director of the international medical spa association was quoted as saying “there are many medical spas operating throughout the united states whose medical director is not necessarily an md ” i do think it is important that a physician and particularly one who is a skin specialist be on site and available at all times after all the decision to initiate treatment is a medical decision secondly what if there is a complication who is more capable of recognizing and treating a complication now medical spas certainly may have medically trained personnel including estheticians who are typically licensed by the state in which they practice generally the state board of cosmetology oversees estheticians and the spa environment however some medical spas take on procedures that are a bit more aggressive than an esthetician may be comfortable with performing if you are considering having a skin care treatment at a medical spa as opposed to a physician is office it would be prudent to ask the following questions 1 is there a md on site or available for me to see 2 what is the medical director is specialty it is not unheard of for some spas to meet the licensure requirement to merely appoint a willing md who is not necessarily trained in skin management the appropriate specialties are plastic surgery facial plastic surgery and dermatology your skin deserves as much prudence in selecting professionals to care for it as any other part of your body

what happens if a broken leg is not ever set in a cast  a psychiatric patient who is anxious and uncooperative with caregivers decides not to go to an orthopedic doctor for evaluation of an already diagnosed broken leg and ankle he stepped in a pothole outside fell and broke lower leg and ankle and had it put in a stabilizer boot only he refuses to go have it further examined and set in a cast what is his prognosis,unless i was able to examine the legankle and have an x ray as a guide there would be no way to guess at an prognosis or outcome some minor fractures can be managed in a boot but i would not know if this treatment would be appropriate for this particular patient    all fractures are different
how can i use duct tape to get rid of warts,ow sorry you are going through this the only way to tell for sure what is going on with your ribcage is to get a physical examination from a health care provider start with your primary care provider he or she can evaluate this problem and refer you for tests x ray for example or a specialist if needed it is not uncommon for the cartilage between ribs to become inflamed or even torn from some sort of trauma which could be as slight as over exercising however the pain you are describing could be caused by something else entirely it could even be related to structures below your ribcage that is why your best bet is to get a physical exam as soon as you can good luck to you you are probably just catching the muscle quickly compressing it and then releasing it the muscle can become injured and stay sore for quit a while try to avoid bending in that manner for a while and try some heat compresses i had the same thing and was told that we have a floating rib i went to therapy they gave me hot packs and sat at the end of a table and reached for a beach ball i left physical therapy and did the same thing at home recently i had the same thing and had a chest xray and cscan and i have a node on my lung but it still feels just like you described my problem still exists did you ever get this figured out i have the same issue

at my vasectomy appointment the doctor could only locate one vas and said he could not do the surgery is this normal  last week i went in for a vasectomy upon physical examination he said he could only feel one vas he said he could not do the procedure in the office and i would need to set up time in the or where i could be put under he said this would allow him to go in to confirm the absence of the second vas is this common should i get a 2nd opinion if only one is found in the initial exam could the procedure still be done in office just for the one and wait for the semen analysis to confirm,incomplete courses of tonsilitis or recurrence in this high frequency indicate the need for tonsillectomy you should go for the surgical option good luck

had sex the condom got stuck inside of me not knowing this to be safe i took plan b then it fell out the day after came in contact with the sperm the day after i took plan b will i still prevent pregnancy,hi this is the answer from plan b site that i think suits your situation yes emergency contraceptive pills also called morning after pills or day after pills only protect against pregnancy when you take them after sex that means you can still get pregnant if you take emergency contraception and then have sex again without using another kind of contraception or your birth control fails if you still do not want to get pregnant you will need to take emergency contraceptive pills again although emergency contraceptive pills would probably still protect you if you had sex immediately after taking them there is no research to show how long they would work  some women find they need emergency contraception more than once because they have not found a regular type of birth control that fits their health and lifestyle needs to find out more about which contraceptives might work best for you click here and be sure to talk to your health care provider if you are having any problems with your birth control hope this helps good luck
is stammering a genetic problem,stammering has got a multiple etiology and pathogenesis a hereditary component in this has been extensively studied a recent study was done including 12 children and 5 generations of the family were investigated the hereditary component is not the only thing that is important there are other factors related to environmental like the way children are brought up the circumstances the child faces etc which will decide this chances of the heriditary component are variable accordingly to different studies it differs with the genetic component of mother and father if both are having this chances of around 25 according to some studies if only one parent is having then chances are still less also the mode of inheritance is also not clearly identified there is a significant limitation in the available literature on these studies my final opinion is the chances are less if the child is brought up in a healthy environment and family with a proper speech there from childhood it should never be a cause to stop marrying i suppose for further information consult an family physician online   > <link>

can douching hurt my chances of having a healthy pregnancy,if you have a fairly regular 28 day cycle a period due on 25th of may would indicate ovulation was expected to be around 11th of may the 4th of may is 7 days before that but sperm only live about 4 days at most 5 days while swimming around searching for the egg pregnancy would seem unlikely but it all depends on the regularity of your cycle and your certainty about the dates provided

87 yr old woman chemo for bladder cancer constant sitter has a growth on the buttocks looks like a lazy eye flap the flap laps over what seems to be an abcess or boil but gets very sore when touched recent x ray showed possible calcifications in the area seems like the flap is made up of fat tissue that has been pulled up from her buttocks flap located right around the pelvis bone top of the buttock area any ideas of what this could be,your theory of weight reduction during wrestling causing your symptoms is really not likely while i do not agree with wrestlers trying to lose weight to compete in a lower weight class i do not think you caused any of your concerns if there are other underlying reasons you will need to see a good medical provider for a diagnostic work up this would not be something that can be done over the internet
can your arteries go from normal to clogged in 7 months i was told i was fine and now i am scared it has changed i went to the cardiologist about seven months ago i had 2 ekgs and an electrocardiogram everything was normal i had a very emotionally stressful week and the entire week i have had anxiety issues during the anxiety i had slight chest pain on my left side i woke up one morning and i my pectoral muscles were tight and felt like i had a strong workout without working out during the next 6 days i have had pain and tingling in my armunder my armpit is this just a reaction on my anxiety,hi i m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety i can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and i felt short of breath to answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in 7 months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods high in salt and fat i would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure

i have not had a period in over 2 5 yrs do i need to stay on the pill,most helpful answer everything i have read says cold if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed this is to increase circulation and promote healing more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body so if you can move do lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re construct those damaged tissues this information is from exercise physiology ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area never place ice directly on your skin however wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10 15 minute intervals always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1 lack of warm up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel

tonsillectomy necesarry to help with psoriasis strep and yeast infections  since november i have had some kind of tonsillitis strep infection 3 times which twice has also been with severe yeast infection swelling my tongue and tonsils making unable to eat solids for a week when i get a strep infection i get a severe case of gutatte psoriasis on 60 of my body which has been treated with every type of steroid cream you can think of but do not work anymore the psoriasis wont shift and antibiotics are not helping much,the most commonly used fillers are made out of hyaluronic acid because of their varying consistency they are used differently prevelle silk is the thinnest of the hyaluronic acid fillers it gives a soft subtle effect that is very natural it is my personal favorite for treating the area around the lips the effects usually last 3 to 4months juvederm is slightly thicker it works well on marionette lines that just beginning to show smile lines and to smooth the contours of jaws that are beginning to sag juvederm usually lasts around 6 8 months although in the lips it does not last as long because the constant movement of the mouth breaks down the filler restylane is one of the older fillers around while many doctors still use it i personally prefer to use juvederm or perlane because i find they give smoother results perlane is the thickest of the hyaluronic acid fillers it is best for deep folds like really pronounced marionette lines or the creases that run down from the nose and around the mouth this is the one people start asking for once they hit forty it lasts for about a year perlane does tend to leave the skin slightly swollen for a couple of days so plan accordingly ifyou have a big event coming up radiesse is a totally different filler in the first place it is made out of calcium it has a firmer consistency which makes it ideal to model cheekbones or jawlines or to fill in very deep marionette lines the problem some doctors have with radiesse is that because it takes so long to dissolve – up to a year in most cases – it is very hard to correct mistakes unsatisfactory radiesse results however are there to stay for the next 12 months

i break out when i use any sunscreen even in a moisturizer how do i find products that will help with wrinkles,so pharmacists want to have a patient that comes to me that tells me about this particular medication and saying that it is not working i have to ask him a few questions i want to find out if they are applying the patch in the right way sometimes patients do not understand that they have to apply a patch to a certain area of the body they also may not understand that one of the things that they need to do is take off the patch that they should not leave the other patch on and then put on another one so i tend to ask a lot of questions about how you are using this patch i will also ask them if they are keeping a diary about how their pain has been since they started it now my skin is going to be different than your skin so patches the drug is actually absorbed through the skin and gives the effect so if your skin might be a little more thicker than mine it might take longer for that drug to pass in this case i also want to ask the patient if he has made the physician fully aware of how he is using the patch and maybe we need to switch him to a different company because they all make different platforms of how the drug is absorbed into the skin so he might need a different type of patch also maybe we need to increase the strength of the patch and see how he does on that so it is a step wise approach and individualized therapy the physician probably wants to try this because at some point because of the past medication he was on he may have developed a tolerance to that medication and it was not really treating his pain so the doctor is probably looking at other options instead to make it a little more easier for the patient
i am 48 and take depo provera and i have no periods how will i know if i am going through menopause  i have been on depo provera for 21 years my doctor does not want me to have the injections anymore i am wondering how long will it take for me to start my periods again after all this time or will my body naturally begin going into menopause,hi and wow 21 years is this a record but can see why women who have been on it between 5 to 10 years can take up to 2 years to get there periods back so you can see why he is bringing you off it who knows you may have already gone through it ok not knowing how these shots affect your hormones perhaps you should have a blood test done now and once every 3 months so your doctor can keep an eye on them its from your hormones that he can tell about the menopause hope this helps good luck

birth control period my husband and i were messing around on day 20 of my 28 pill pack some come got on me we are at a stand still with sex bc of my anxiety of getting pregnant my question is if i have what i consider a normal as scheduled period while on birth control day 3 of sugar pills do i need to worry about being pregnant from this incident do i need to worry at all i take my pill everyday and my husband is so irritated with me right now we do have two planned kids and i do not want anymore right now,hi when taken correctly birth control pills can be up to 99 effective in preventing pregnancy however women who are taking birth control pills do on rare occasions get pregnant when this happens it is most often because of something the women did or more likely did not do not because the pill itself somehow failed to work things like not taken the pill at the same time each day missing a day alcohol will lower its effect and some meds will also lower its effect for the first one use you mobile phone it has an alarm us it for your pill this way it goes of the same time each day use it ok if you think you may be pregnant just keep taken your bc pills see if you miss your period if you do then get a test done either an hpt or at your doctors but for you its just a waiting game till the end of your current cycle hope this has helped good luck

do diet pills interact with depression and bipolar meds such as wellbutrin and geodon,i also have been on sooo many anti depressants and other meds for bipolar ii and always gained weight i am a 40 year old woman who is 51 tall and at that time almost 150 pounds but i was just prescribed a very new anti depressant called fetzima there is not any generic version as of yet i am on the max dose at 80mg daily but add lamictal adderall xanax seroquel ambien xr propranolol imitrex injections cambia liquid spinx nasal spray and lastly phenergen 25mg prn migraine with vomiting but my point which i apologize for going off in so many directions thanks to the adderall 60mg daily the fetzima is supposedly much better as far as weight is concerned it actually lists that weight loss is more common than weight gain and while i would never suggest anyone to be on a stimulantadderall when i have never been addadhd i take it daily and in a pretty decent dosage to somehow get me to function thru the day it is hard to figure out as the patient why a doctor would put you on a lot of uppers and then you need downers it is crazy but with the adderall i have been on for almost 3 months and in all honestly i now weigh 103 pounds so over 45 plus pounds in that 3 months i can not describe the feeling of having absolute no appetite i actually do not eat anything until my 11 year old daughter is home from school then while i am making her a snack and later dinner for the family i try my best to eat a few bites here and there cause i do not want my daughter to think i am trying on purpose to not eat cause i want to be skinny and so i lose all my weight in my breasts my butt arms and legs and my face is caving in i will always have a larger stomach after childbirth but if things continue like this i will end up in the hospital so please think seriously what is most important as far as getting out of the depression that is so dark been there but if you do end up with weight gain side effect please either eat very healthy and exercise safely and hopefully the depression meds will help enough you will find more days to not just take care of your mental illness but start living healthy and happier i wish you all the best and know that depression can be just as or more fatal than being a little overweight or very underweight best wishes malissa
i have recently gone to the dentist and said they found oral cancer,in the past celiac disease was considered to be a disease primarily of infants and children it is now clear that initial signs and symptoms of celiac disease can occur in adults and even in the elderly symptoms in infants infants with celiac disease typically have diarrhea steatorrhea abdominal cramps abdominal distension irritability muscle wasting and failure to thrive and grow these symptoms typically occur after the introduction of gluten containing cereals into their diets symptoms in children children with celiac disease typically have diarrhea increased amounts of fat in the stool steatorrhea flatulence passing gas short stature and weight loss proper treatment with a gluten free diet can lead to accelerated catch up growth in height however if untreated childhood celiac disease can result in short stature as an adult as children with celiac disease enter adolescence many will experience spontaneous remissions reduced symptoms and remain free of the signs and symptoms of celiac disease until later in adulthood this later reactivation can be precipitated by stress such as pregnancy or surgery symptoms in adults adults with celiac disease may have symptoms of diarrhea steatorrhea weight loss and flatulence however many adults do not have diarrhea or steatorrhea they have either no symptoms or only vague abdominal discomfort such as bloating abdominal distension and excess gas they also may have only one or a few signs of malnutrition such as iron deficiency anemia abnormal bleeding or bone fractures some individuals with celiac disease and gastrointestinal symptoms are mistakenly diagnosed to have irritable bowel syndrome ibs there have been changes during the past 20 years in the way in which celiac disease is diagnosed the average age at which celiac disease is diagnosed has increased probably because of the increased awareness that the disease can first cause symptoms or signs in adults whereas in the past diarrhea was the initial symptom in 80 of patients it now is the initial symptom in only 40 a small proportion of patients   about 15   are now diagnosed with blood antibody tests because they have a close relative with celiac disease and they are being screened to see if they also have the disease

what are advantagesdisadvatages in taking med marijuana i have chronic daily headaches chronic headache syndrome ptsd anxietyfrequent anxiety attacks which lead to twitching and convulsions depression migraines convulsions and more i have been taking zoloft for my depression and i have 4 different therapistspsychologistspsychotherapists which i all frequently see i do not like taking mainstream medications because i do not like putting harmful chemicals in my body and i do not like the way they make me feel sometimes,the benefits are less usage of prescription pain medication regaining an appetite far fewer effects from stress and anxiety depression and it helps with apathy greater empathy for others with like problems and i could probably quit taking some of the 15+ other medications i am now taking another benefit is the time your mind is occupied with while growing learning and having someone to talk to who never talks back but show their appreciation by growing up big and strong the down side of mj use is uhh is is oh yeah some short term memory loss there are some things i would rather forget than be troubled with every day another down side is the cost unless you are allowed to grow this medicine for yourself and of course you do not drive under the influence of marijuana the first problem with mj is use is the amount of time the chemicals remain in your body even though you are no longer high from mj it will still be found in a ua or blood test and even when the effects have left your brain you may still be found guilty of being under the influence unless you have an enlightened judge one other problem is doctors i treat with a pain clinic and if i turn in a dirty ua i am assured will receive no further pain prescription pain medication i am not sure if this would be legal to allow a person to have to go through withdrawals from oxycontin and hydrocodone i have done it once when i lost my bottle of pain pills and it was not enjoyable when i use pot i use far fewer of them and i doubt now that i would suffer nearly as much as i would when going without there are no withdrawal from marijuana for me anyway and i cannot believe anyone could actually be called and consider themselves addicted to mj it is the loss of being allowed it is use that brings on added stress and more depression after having used mj for the prior 28 years for a low back injury and before having to switch doctors i was just fine close to the same has now occurred in the mobile home park where i reside facing eviction if i were to be found guilty of doing what the state tells me i can do i have now taken a do not ask do not tell attitude i will use again and i will grow again with or without anyone is permission even and i hate this if i have to lie to health care workers i have this problem because i have been honest with my physicians never again will i mention marijuana this sucks

i have a sister who is not 69 years old and not eligible for medicare because she does not have the work credits her income is approximately 17 000 a year what type of low cost medical insurance will she be eligible for,this is a great question webmd offers a fun quiz about water intake try it out to see how you score unfortunately there is no good scientific answer to your question the institute of medicine recommends men get 125 ounces of water daily from all sources that includes fruits vegetables and other sources women need slightly less than that the quiz linked above states the u s government is dietary guidelines for americans does not recommend purposeful drinking of water for hydration unless you routinely engage in vigorous physical activity or are exposed to heat stress so unless you are constipated or compete in triathlons you are probably getting enough water just by drinking normally and eating some fruits and vegetables hope this helps

will antibiotics reduce the effect of oral contraceptive pills,with emphysema there is permanent enlargement of the alveoli due to destruction of the walls between alveoli alveoli are the thin walled sacs in the lungs where gas transfer takes place  the destruction of the alveolar walls reduces the elasticity of the lung overall this loss of elasticity leads to the collapse of the bronchioles the small airways leading to the alveoli obstructing airflow out of the alveoli air becomes trapped in the alveoli and reduces the ability of the lung to shrink during exhalation the reduced expansion of the lung during the next breath reduces the amount of air that is inhaled as a result less air for the exchange of gases gets into the lungs this trapped air also can compress adjacent less damaged lung tissue preventing it from functioning to its fullest capacity the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the air and the blood in the capillaries takes place across the thin walls of the alveoli destruction of the alveolar walls decreases the number of capillaries available for gas exchange this adds to the decrease in the ability to exchange gases usually energy is required only for inhalation to inflate the lungs the stretch of the lungs and distension of the chest cavity springs back to rest during exhalation a passive process that does not require energy however in emphysema extra effort and energy has to be expended to empty the lungs of air due to the collapse of the airways this essentially doubles the work of breathing since now energy is required for both inhalation and exhalation in addition because of the reduced capacity to exchange gases with each breath due to the collapse of the bronchioles and loss of capillaries it is necessary to breathe more frequently

hi um 21 years old and i have been trying to get pregnant for almolst 2 years,most couples are able to become pregnant within the first 12 months of having regular unprotected sex if after a year of trying a woman under 35 is still not pregnant then a checkup is in order to see if there is a problem there are many reasons why a couple may have a problem getting pregnant sometimes it is a health issue for the man and sometimes it is a health issue for the woman a woman can have a problem with her hormones or with her womb or fallopian tubes a man may not have enough healthy sperm sometimes both the man and woman can have an infertility problem just because you are not pregnant yet does not mean that you can not have a healthy baby you should make an appointment with your gynecologist and have your partner see his doctor or urologist to see what may be the cause your doctor will most likely give you a prenatal vitamin to be sure that your pregnancy gets a healthy start in the meantime make sure you are eating a healthy diet get enough exercise and avoid tobacco alcohol and any drugs that have not been prescribed by your doctor for more information check out this link to webmd is infertility and reproduction health center <link>

ho you treat otitis media with effusion and vertigo  i have been given steriods and meclizine after two days i still have ear pain fullness in my left ear and vertigo should i return to the pa at the little clinic in kroger grocery store or see an ent,most helpful answer that is an excellent question you do want to take care during intercourse if you have significant curvature of the penis have you been evaluated by a health care provider for this some curvature of the penis during erection is normal however too much curvature can be a sign of peyronie is disease which is caused by scar tissue within the erectile tissue of the penis peyronie is is not caused by cancer nor does it contribute to an increased risk of cancer it also is not caused by a sexually transmitted disease whether or not you have peyronie is disease if you have significant curvature of the penis you probably want to avoid very vigorous thrusting during sex not only could this be painful for you it could be painful for your partner it is probably a good idea too to become familiar with sexual positions that make insertion easier and do not cause the penis to bend mid shaft you do not want to experience a penile fracture do not be embarrassed to discuss this situation with your health care provider he or she can give you specific information about what to do to avoid injuring your penis during intercourse it might facilitate intercourse if you have her stand around the corner if it is really bent then you might have peyronie is disease and should see a doctor but if there is a slight curve that is no big deal few men have a straight penis so basically all you have to worry about is pregnancy and disease use condoms and an antibacterial penis health creme and you will be just fine i use one called man1 man oil it is great cheers
give me a list of grains fruits veggies beans that are rich in good carbohydrates,when it comes to carbs we generally divide them into two groups refined and unrefined some people refer to these as bad carbs and good carbs  respectively in general refined carbohydrates are less valuable nutritionally than unrefined whole carbs so a list of unrefined whole carbohydrates might include all raw frozen or canned vegetables though canned vegetables can contain excessive salt all raw or frozen fruit without added sugar all whole grains brown rice whole wheat pasta all whole or canned beans be careful with potatoes white and red skinned golden etc  potatoes can cause blood sugar to spike after eating also be careful with so called whole grain breads read bread labels carefully or buy from a bakery that grinds its own grain a simple way to evaluate bread is by its mass weightiness in your hand if a bread feels heavy and dense it is probably a good whole grain loaf when it comes to fruits some contain more natural sugars than others grapes are very sugary and should not be a first choice for people with diabetes for example canned fruits often contain a lot of added sugar so again read labels carefully of course remember sugar of any kind is a carbohydrate refined sugars including granulated white or brown sugar and powdered sugar is not good in excess watch for hidden sugars in prepared foods and beverages good for you for trying to improve your diet eating a variety of fresh vegetables fruits and whole grains is good for your health wishing you well the mayo clinic website has great info and detailed food lists for diabetics etc should be able to find what you want there also elizabeth has given you good info i am a type 2 diabetic and can validate what she advises the more processed a food item is the worse it is for us read the label those whole grain breads use processed wheat white flour as a base with enough whole wheat flour and often molasses for coloring luckily i was raised by my grandparents in the late 40 is and 50 is on a farm and learned how to eat and cook from the basics you should learn that if you want to survive diabetes old fashioned rolled oats will become your best friend during a sweet attack i have found that homemade white cornbread is relatively non offensive believe it or not and do not waste your money on sucralose it does not sweeten diddly when cooking plain old walmart aspartame works just fine good luck
if you have a curve to your penis does that effect how you would inject a trimix ed shot  my penis has a visible curve to the left of maybe 15 degrees or so i know the injection site for trimix can be either 10 or 2 oclock on the bottom side of the penis since i do have that curve to the left would that affect how i would administer the shot or would it be fine and not cause any further damage to the curved portion of my penis,orchitis would be higher on the list than a testicular cancer but both need to be considered you need a testicular ultrasound doppler as soon as you can get it and of course a visit to a urologist testicular cancer does not really act like this it is not very helpful to worry unnecessarily about these things until you get a diagnosis i am sorry that i cannot be more specific but making these blind guesses is not something that medical professionals are fond of doing we like to see these problems first hand look at the imaging studies and then and only then make a presumptive diagnosis hang in there my friend no pun intended

will birth control pills clear up my acne,for many women even if their periods are regular you need some type of hormonal balance in order to help control the acne i have patients who tell me that they never had acne as a teenager now they are in their 20s 30s and sometimes even 40s and all of a sudden they are starting to get acne and invariably this acne is in the lower face not the teenage form where it is in the middle face and forehead but really along the jawline and the lower face and even along the submental along the neck and the jawline underneath a little bit as well this acne can be very difficult to control with the treatments that we use in teenagers so i still use antibiotics by mouth and topical treatments such as the retinoids retin a and tazorac benzoyl peroxide things like that but when i add an oral contraceptive or another medicine called spironolactone or aldactone that is the same drug in the brand and generic name that often works really well to control their acne and make anything else i do work that much better but it does need to be under the supervision of your dermatologist

what causes a dropped tip after a nose job,sometimes patients are disappointed after rhinoplasty or nose surgery because various changes can evolve negatively in the postoperative period one of the more common effects is the so called “dropped tip ” here is what that means initially when seen from the side the profile view the tip sits at a desirable level in relation to the rest of the nose is profile but with time the tip actually settles down drops and gives a round or convex appearance to the front half of the profile it may look like a new bump has formed there are several reasons why this happens in most cases such a drop is predictable — and preventable the first reason is that the surgeon fails to allow for an anticipated drop and therefore incorrectly sets the tip position in reference to the rest of the nasal profile including the bridge it is well known among experienced nasal surgeons that there will always be some downward contraction of the tip owing to the fact that their incisions tend to contract the natural downward pull of gravity and contractile forces from those incisions will tend to make the tip drop the surgeon must anticipate that during the planning of your operation and during its execution the second common reason for the tip dropping is that there is not enough strength in the remaining tip cartilage to maintain its position if the surgeon fails to recognize that the tip cartilage is weak and will not hold its posture after part of it has been removed to narrow the lower half of the nose then such a dropped tip will occur and the profile will be imperfect an assessment of the prospects of that happening should take place at the consultation as the surgeon feels the strength of the nasal cartilages and makes an estimate as to what percentage of the strength can be maintained after a portion of the cartilage is removed here is the analogy in architecture and construction if you weaken a load bearing support wall too much the roof will sag or come tumbling down reason number three for the “dropped tip” is that in fact the tip does not drop but the tissue of the nose above the tip rises up and makes it look like the tip has dropped this is generally due to the surgeon is failure to anticipate the contraction and tightening that will certainly take place during healing as swelling diminishes and the tissues begin to weld together an upward elevation of the cartilages in the midportion of the nose can occur these “upper lateral” cartilages automatically and naturally migrate toward the middle and if they had not been trimmed enough in anticipation of this migration then they tend to rise above the anticipated profile level thus a profile convexity occurs that makes the tip look as though it has dropped an illusion has been created rhinoplasty is a complex operation which requires imagination on the part of the

i recently had my tattoo removal surgery for 4th session is it hypertropic scar or keloid,hi found you this info do hope it helps all the way down to sorry your see why the normal volume varies from 1 5 to 5 0 milliliters per ejaculation 9or the loving spoonful or 10cc should ring a bell the sperm count varies from 20 to 150 million sperm per milliliter that means each time you ejaculate you put out tens of millions of sperm in one teaspoonful  see the loving spoonful it only takes one sperm to fertilize one egg for a pregnancy at least 60 of the sperm should show normal forward movement motility you had 30 some factors which can reduce the percentage include alcohol tobacco drugs and time by time i mean the longer the sample of semen sits before it is analyzed the more the percentage will go down so my first question to you and the lab is did the lab do the motility analysis in the short time without waiting too long a repeat analysis of another very fresh sample may give you a much higher percent even so you have more than enough motility now for successful pregnancy when you marry normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results several factors reduce sperm motility exposure to heat possibly through the presence of a varicocele while sperm mature in the epididymis can damage sperm hindering their motility long periods of sexual inactivity can also adversely prevent motility studies have shown that poor motility is seen in the first ejaculate after a prolonged period of sexual inactivity whereas sperm motility improves in the following ejaculate reproductive health care providers can perform several procedures to improve sperm motility several products on the market claim to increase sperm motility some claim to provide proteins or enzymes needed for sperm to become healthy  while some products are currently being tested no products have approval from the u s food and drug administration fda as of yet sorry for the humour so your 30 so your half way there but getting pregnant is all down to timing yes so your wifes cycle day one first day of her period day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day yes the day her egg drops now you need to have sex around 4 to 5 days before it takes 3 days for your sperm to get in place so by doing that your sperm is there just waiting for her egg and your sperm will live to 5 to 10 days depending where you read if all goes well on day 21 she should get some spotting if so this means the fertilised egg has buried itself in her womb if she then miss is her next period she then gets tested if all goes to plan you should end up with a baby do hope this helps you good luck ps just try this first but do not forget having

when a prescription says take with meals  is that during the meal or after the meal,i think they generally do and unfortunately men handle it in a way that is counter productive we have noticed that more men will begin to drink alcohol excessively and that is probably because they want to be seen as strong and if they go to a doctor for any kind of help with this it will mean that they are not men so better to drink and try to drink your troubles away than to try and get some help women on the other hand will say look if i am this stressed i have got to go get some help we know that more women enter therapy than man that has always been as long as i can remember and they have been keeping statistics that women are willing to talk to others and to try to come to terms with how do i cope with this how can i change this what am i missing they will talk about their problems men will talk about the baseball scores they will not talk about their problems that is why the statistics are skewed probably that they say that women have more anxiety and depression than men no it is because more women show up at the office and get counted and men do not get counted if we went into bars and started doing some kind of research i would wonder before they took their first drink how would they register on stress measures on anxiety depression measures and i think we would find a rather dramatic shift you know what is stopping them what is so unmanly about getting help when you need it if you have hypertension and you are a man you go and get help is that unmanly no if you have anxiety and stress that is causing you serious problems and can end up in a heart attack is that unmanly or should you go and get some help just the way you got with your hypertension remember these kinds of illnesses are just as important and can have as catastrophic results as the medical illnesses that you have accepted all these years

i am sure i have strep throat i am allergic to penicillins and i think i am getting better do i really need meds  on tuesday afternoon i had a tickle in my throat win 3 hours i had a severe sore throat a fever no energy and swollen nodes the next day i had white patches on my tonsils but today there is only 1 tiny one left i have not had a fever for a day and half i have more energy and feel a little better do i really need antibiotics i am allergic to penicillin anyway if it seems like i am fighting it off i know there can be complications but they are rare and i do not think i am an at risk person,yes your symptoms could have been an allergic response not all allergic responses have breathing difficulties but most will have some degree of itching or hives symptoms you did not mention a swollen throat that suddenly came on after eating something certainly is suspicious of an allergic reaction a bacterial disease especially one that would require an antibiotic would typically not come on this sudden oral steroids can counteract an allergic reaction so perhaps that helped you
what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy,about 20 of women have some bleeding during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy possible causes of first trimester bleeding include implantation bleeding you may experience some normal spotting within the first six to 12 days after you conceive as the fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus some women do not realize they are pregnant because they mistake this bleeding for a light period usually the bleeding is very light and lasts from a few hours to a few days miscarriage because miscarriage is most common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it tends to be one of the biggest concerns with first trimester bleeding about half of women who bleed in pregnancy eventually miscarry but that does not necessarily mean that if you are bleeding you have lost the baby especially if you do not have any other symptoms other symptoms of miscarriage are strong cramps in the lower abdomen and tissue passing through the vagina ectopic pregnancy in an ectopic pregnancy the fertilized embryo implants outside of the uterus usually in the fallopian tube if the embryo keeps growing it can cause the fallopian tube to burst which can be life threatening to the mother although ectopic pregnancy is potentially dangerous it only occurs in about 2 of pregnancies other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are strong cramps or pain in the lower abdomen and lightheadedness molar pregnancy also called gestational trophoblastic disease this is a very rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside the uterus instead of a baby in rare cases the tissue is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body other symptoms of molar pregnancy are severe nausea and vomiting and rapid enlargement of the uterus additional causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include cervical changes during pregnancy extra blood flows to the cervix intercourse or a pap test which cause contact with the cervix can trigger bleeding this type of bleeding is not cause for concern infection any infection of the cervix vagina or a sexually transmitted infection such as chlamydia gonorrhea or herpes can cause bleeding in the first trimester

question about passing genital herpes onto someone i have genital herpes and my partner is worried that i may have passed it to him after he tasted my fluids he basically rubbed my vagina then stuck his fingers in his mouth to taste me i had no outbreak or lesions at the time is it possible that i could have passed my herpes onto him,tendinitis means inflammation of the tendon  therefore technically you can get tendinitis anywhere there is a tendon    and that includes your shoulder tendinitis of the shoulder probably is less common than say tendinitis of the elbow if you are experiencing pain in both shoulders at the same time chances are it is not tendinitis it would be unusual for tendons in opposite joints to flare up at the same time bilateral shoulder pain could indicate something else such as muscle spasms across the top of the back or perhaps a herniated disc in the spinal column though the symptoms from that often are one sided as well another possibility for pain in both shoulders simultaneously is osteoarthritis this definitely could flare up in both joints at the same time of course i am not a doctor so these are just examples of the types of things that could possibly cause shoulder pain if you are having pain in a joint your best bet is to see a medical provider wishing you well

how can insulin dosage effect cortisol levels 88 yo diabetic checked for possible heart attack ruled out was told insulin dosage may be too high causing cortisol reaction that caused his symptoms,cortisol plays an important role in human nutrition it regulates energy by selecting the right type and amount of substrate carbohydrate fat or protein the body needs to meet the physiological demands placed on it when chronically elevated cortisol can have deleterious effect on weight immune function and chronic disease risk cortisol along with epinephrine is best known for its involvement in what the medical profession say in the fight or flight response and temporary increase in energy production at the expense of processes that are not required for immediate survival let me see if i can clarify this an individual or person is faced with a stressor a complex hormonal cascade ensues and the adrenals secrete cortisol then cortisol prepares the body for a fight or flight response by flooding it with glucose supplying an immediate energy source to large muscles cortisol inhibits insulin production in an attempt to prevent glucose from being stored favoring its immediate use cortisol narrows the arteries while the epinephrine increases heart rate both of which force blood to pump harder and faster then this may cause the person to think he may be having a heart attack the individual addresses and resolves the situation hormone levels return to normal in short the theory is that with our ever stressed fast paced lifestyle our bodies are pumping out cortisol almost constantly which can cause problems on our health our whole bodies are mediated by hormones and the immune system identifies cortisol as just one of many players but if we isolate its role we can put into context the many complex mechanisms that lead to specific physiological damage under stressful conditions cortisol provides the body with glucose by tapping into protein stores via gluconeogenesis in the liver this energy can help an indiviual fight or flee a stressor however elevated cortisol over the long term consistently produces glucose leading to increased blood sugar levels ask your doctor for any information on diabetes and tell him what specifically you are looking for i am sure that they have the information if you still are having problems ask your doctor to send you to a diabetic counselor or management counselor to help you to understand diabetes i do hope you get to feeling better and please keep us informed how you are doing thank you

how much water should i drink when exercising what will happen if i drink too much,the national athletic trainers association recommends the following hydration guidelines for exercise 1 two to three hours pre exercise 17 to 20 fluid ounces of water or sports drink 2 ten to 20 minutes pre exercise 7 to 10 ounces of water or sports drink 3 during exercise fluid replacement should approximate sweat and urine losses and at least maintain hydration at less than 2 body weight reduction this generally requires 7 to 10 ounces of water or sports drink every 10 to 20 minutes include carbohydrates in the beverage if the exercise is intense or lasts more then 45 50 minutes water alone will suffice and save calories if the exercise is moderate or less than 45 50 minutes 4 post exercise athletes should weigh themselves nude before and after workouts to learn how much weight is lost from sweat water and salt and then ingest fluid equal to 150 of the weight loss ideally within two hours and no more than four to six hours after the event including sodium in the drink allows fluid volume to be better conserved and increases the drive to drink and carbohydrate in the drink will improve the rate of intestinal absorption of the fluid as well as replenish glycogen stores in the muscles and liver 5 the volume of fluid in the stomach is critically important for proper hydration maintaining 12 to 20 ounces of fluid in the stomach will optimize gastric emptying and prevent dehydration concentrations of 4 to 8 of carbohydrates should be used if they are included in the fluid for example gatorade and other energy drinks concentrations higher than 8 slow the rate of fluid absorption while 6 to 8 concentrations are optimal for hydration and performance the effects of dehydration can be profound they are 1 a loss of just 1 to 2 of body weight begins to compromise cardiovascular body temperature regulation and muscular function and can lead to decreases in aerobic power for example heart rate rises an additional three to five beats per minute for every 1 of body weight loss 2 muscle endurance and maximal aerobic power decreases when 3 to 4 of body weight is lost slightly more than 2 loss of body weight can result in as much as a 35 to 48 reduction in physical work capacity 3 dehydration of greater than 3 of body weight increases the risk of developing exertional heat illness heat cramps heat exhaustion or heat stroke heat illness is common in sports and can occur after just one hour of intense exercise in the heat as for drinking too much there has been a great deal of discussion and some controversy recently over the issue of over hydration during athletic events and the risk of abnormally low sodium hyponatremia it started when runners at a marathon presented at the finish line with what appeared to be dehydration the medical people confused the symptoms of hyponatremia with dehydration the symptoms are similar and so they

after start of treatment how long is pink eye contagious,since antibiotic eye drops are used from 5 10 days and not all pink eye conjunctivitis is bacterial viral and allergic conjunctivitis does not respond to antibiotic drops i usually tell my patients to use the drops at least 24 hours and see an improvement before returning to school assuming this is a child the drops should be administered at school on the same schedule adults are less likely to spread this infection simply because they practice a higher level of personal hygiene so returning to work is usually not restricted unless the infection is extensive

how to tell if you have fractured bone in hand  i went to er for x rays after my hand was crushed in the rollers of an electric fence they said nothing was broken my hand is swollen and bruised and the bone for my second finger in my hand hurts to touch and feels like there is a rubber band going from my second finger down into my hand my knuckle also feels like its popping in and out when i bend my finger was just wondering if maybe a fracture was missed and if i should ask for another x ray this happend thurs 11 15 12 3 days ago,a crush injury can cause some considerable soft tissue damage and that may not be evident on a plain x ray or even on an examination yes fractures can be missed by the person reading them and the radiologist so repeat x rays are often ordered however if your injury was severe and you are having that array of symptoms seeing an orthopedist or a hand specialist may be a logical next step at has only been three days so things may still settle down with cold compresses and anti inflammatory medications but there is nothing inappropriate in arranging an orthopedic consultation for next week

what kind of after care should i expect from my cosmetic surgeon,i think the patient has a right to expect attentive post operative care and post operative care with a lot of forethought meaning that the doctor is prepared me for what to expect so i am not worried and second has given me all the things i need to provide my own home care everything from little creams for the skin to dressing supplies to pain pills to sleeping pills to anti bruising pills not just say we will see you in a week good bye in other words you have got to counsel the patient and then i believe to best serve that patient give them what they need do not say here is a prescription if you have some pain and then the patient is family has to stand in line at a drugstore at 3 in the morning because all of a sudden they are uncomfortable no the better practices give the patient a kit a bag that has in it everything that they would be expected to need and if the patient said you know unfortunately i have got a history of having nausea after i have had previous procedures we do not want them to have nausea we do not want them to have vomiting because that can interfere with their comfort and also even has a bearing on the outcome so you prescribe an anti nausea medication and say guess what we are going to give this to you even before you go to sleep for the surgery in other words always thinking ahead what to expect and convenience and service to the patient why should the family have to worry about the pain medicine no this is all laid out ahead of time and when the consultation takes place issues of pain and pain control should come up so we are prepared 11 we ask the patient have you ever have surgery yes did you have any problems with surgery did you have pain did you have nausea did you have vomiting that is the time for these things to come out and when the patient says let me tell you something i took tylenol with codeine and i felt terrible i was nauseated it did not agree with my stomach well we are not going to use tylenol with codeine we are going to prepare and we will have a substitute in the bag ready for them so they do not have to worry about it so i think the patient is entitled to as much as attention to detail after the surgery as they are during the surgery where every stitch should be put in with attention to detail this is all about detail if a doctor is not detail oriented and compulsive probably will not have as gratifying a career
why do i get red spots on the edges of my lips after i have exercised  i get a few red spots on the edges of my lips after i have done a lot of cardio and gotten really hot it seems like they are in the spots where i have had cold sores in the past maybe where they have scarred or something they pretty much only show up after a good exercise on a regular basis and before exercise these spots seem to be less pigmented less lip colored like how tiny scars might look,hi found you this info it could be this exercise induced urticaria is a condition that causes hives and other allergic symptoms it can occur during or after exercise hives or welts are usually raised flat bumps on the skin that are more red around the edge than in the middle hives may also look like red spots blotches or blisters they can occur on any part of the body if so i would see your doctor good luck

how can i cure acid reflux  i ate a large meal and went to bed right after and 4 hours later woke up with a burning throat gargled some cold water and saw some blood got worried gargled couple of more times but the bleeding got worse rushed to a doctor and got some medications but i still sometimes feel its hard to sleep and when i wake up my throat feels very dry even though i have woken up couple of times to drink water,most helpful answer the primary approach to properly managing acid reflux should be to actively identify and avoid certain foods that trigger your symptoms here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux • fatty foods • acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomato containing products • coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol • chocolate or peppermint • spicy foods • garlic or onions also try to refrain from lying down after meals eating too much in one sitting eating less than two hours before going to bed or exercising or eating too quickly quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms as well i would suggest journaling your dietary intake and activities each day so that you can notice any trends in what might be provoking your symptoms if you continue to experience acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter products or prescription medication certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux too but it is more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding your triggers consult with your doctor about long term treatmentmanagement options and visit the webmd heartburngerd health center for more information <link>

i have hanging moles on my neck that hurt at times and are just plain irritating how can i get rid of them,tuberculosis can be diagnosed in several different ways including chest x rays analysis of sputum and skin tests sometimes the chest x rays can reveal evidence of active tuberculosis pneumonia other times the x rays may show scarring fibrosis or hardening calcification in the lungs suggesting that the tb is contained and inactive examination of the sputum on a slide smear under the microscope can show the presence of the tuberculosis like bacteria bacteria of the mycobacterium family including atypical mycobacteria stain positive with special dyes and are referred to as acid fast bacteria a sample of the sputum also is usually taken and grown cultured in special incubators so that the tuberculosis bacteria can subsequently be identified as tuberculosis or atypical tuberculosis several types of skin tests are used to screen for tb infection these so called tuberculin skin tests include the tine test and the mantoux test also known as the purified protein derivative test in each of these tests a small amount of purified extract from dead tuberculosis bacteria is injected under the skin if a person is not infected with tb then no reaction will occur at the site of the injection a negative skin test if a person is infected with tuberculosis however a raised and reddened area will occur around the site of the test injection this reaction a positive skin test occurs about 48 to 72 hours after the injection if the infection with tuberculosis has occurred recently however the skin test can be falsely negative the reason for a false negative test with a recent infection is that it usually takes two to 10 weeks after the time of infection with tuberculosis before the skin test becomes positive the skin test can also be falsely negative if a person is immune system is weakened or deficient due to another illness such as aids or cancer or while taking medications that can suppress the immune response such as cortisone or anticancer drugs remember however that the tb skin test cannot determine whether the disease is active or not this determination requires the chest x rays andor sputum analysis smear and culture in the laboratory the organism can take up to six weeks to grow in culture in the microbiology lab a special test to diagnose tb called the pcr polymerase chain reaction detects the genetic material of the bacteria this test is extremely sensitive it detects minute amounts of the bacteria and specific it detects only the tb bacteria one can usually get results from the pcr test within a few days

what is emphysema,emphysema is a long term progressive disease of the lungs that occurs when the alveolar walls are destroyed along with the capillary blood vessels that run within them this lessens the total area within the lung where blood and air can come together limiting the potential for oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer in early emphysema there is associated inflammation of the small airways or bronchioles which limits the amount of air that can flow to the alveoli in more severe emphysema there is also a loss of elasticity in the alveolar walls that have not been destroyed when the patient breathes out the alveoli and small airways collapse this makes it hard for air to get out of the lungs and makes it even harder for new air to enter as more of the lung is destroyed and the lung cannot maintain oxygen concentrations in the bloodstream the body compensates by gradually increasing the breathing rate after awhile even hyperventilation hyper=more + ventilation=breathing cannot maintain adequate oxygen levels and the arteries in the lung begin to constrict or narrow the heart has to work harder to push blood into these narrower blood vessels causing the blood pressure in the lung arteries to increase pulmonary hypertension over time the extra work requirement causes the heart muscle to enlarge hypertrophy and can cause heart failure

what is viral hepatitis,lice are live so a person exposed can have live lice relatively fast if the encounter was sufficient head to head activities use of combsbrushes sharing hats all can transmit lice from one person to the next almost immediately nits are either unhatched eggs or the remnants of hatched egges obviously the unhatched eggs are problematic since they will hatch in about two weeks and be mobile soon they will be laying there own eggs nits are firmly glued to the hair shaft the unhatched nits are within a 14 or so of the scalp the nits do not easily transfer from person to person unless it is with combs or brushes live lice do not live long off of their chosen human hosts    several hours at best they gotta eat  so exposure from carpets furniture etc is possible but considerably less likely you will need to check your kids and each other for the next week looking for live lice and nits they can be elusive so look carefully if you do not find them you are probably in the clear from this unwanted birthday party gift if you do find them they will need to be promptly treated this is a gift that can keep on giving
i bought listerine zero and it has no ada symbol will it help my gums like normal listerine does,who says that listerine is good for your gums i personally never understood this fascination that people have with rinsing the only thing that controls gingivitis prevents periodontitis and bad breath is the actual act of brushing and flossing one is teeth everything else is just fluff there are mouthwashes that can help control the deleterious bacteria in our mouth mainly chlorhexidine peridex however they are by prescription and stain our teeth they are used by many peridontists and other dentists to control bacteria after dental surgery but we recommend their use only for a limited time in addition if you ask dental pathologists the specialists in the diseases of the mouth many will tell you that many mouthwashes are laden with alcohol which actually damages our gums it is compounded by the fact that people rinse their mouth with an alcohol based mouthwash and then go and smoke a cigarette they kill that top protective layer of cells with the alcohol and introduce the carcinogens from the cigarettes right into the sub layer of the gums causing more damage review your brushing technique and timing speak to your hygienistdentistperiodontist about proper brushing technique and use the mouth rinse when you need fresh breath for a few minutes this is how long the effects of mouthwash last as to the ada approval any reputable company can pay the fee required to get the ada seal it is a great marketing device but the real agency of approval is the fda food and drug administration if a product is approved to be sold by a pharmacy it is likely to have fda approval that should be ok my recommendation do not waste your hard earned money on mouthwashes spend your money on professional cleanings and go to a dentisthygienist who cares enough to give you feedback on your home care and educate you in proper hygiene you will get much more bang for your buck

can you lactate during pregnancy,cavities or tooth decay is chronic infections that spread further at a slow rate in most cases the other thing to consider is any pain or associated symptoms with the cavities which are indicative of active acute infection that has already spread deeper so if the cavities are without symptoms then it would be fine to wait for a few months as well however depending on the current state of infection which can be evident from x ray i could give a more conclusive answer about the wisdom teeth if these are unerupted at your age then it is recommended that you get them removed as they present a chance for cyst formation etc it is not urgent though this is more prophylactic than definitive complications of removing wisdom teeth depend upon the location and position of the wisdom teeth yes a very small chance for more complications at a later age but the overall complexity would have been informed by the dentist or oral surgeon already for further information consult a dentist online   > <link>

i was told i have reuthmoid arthritis all over my body whats gonna happen to my body will i still be able to work  i am a 58yr old woman construction worker who was told today that i have rheumatoid arthritis all over my body what is gonna happen to me now can i be treated for it can i still work 2fingers on my hand are crooked and i get pain in my legs,yes it can help your situation having penile implant surgery is a major life changing decision my friend is husband had the surgery performed twice the first surgical procedure resulted in lots of pain and a deformed looking penis the 2nd surgery done 4 years ago had more positive results there are multiple types of implants to meet your needs here are the disadvantages and advantages as i know them to be   non inflatable type   a rod is implanted and is simply bent up to reveal the erect penis it is easy to use for individuals with dexterity or arthritic conditions the downside is that the man will have a constant erection the penis is always erect and just needs to be bent upwards to reveal the erection this can be annoying and sometimes painful this appliance can also cause a thinning of the penile flesh and can be perceived as having an abnormal appearance   2 piece inflatable appliance  it is promoted as being easy to use because the man simply pumps it up to have an erect penis and pumps it down when not in use fluid is transferred into cylinders which become firm and imitate an erect penis with this devise the penis is not as firm as with other appliances may be difficult to inflate and can cause penile tissue thinning   3 piece inflatable units   the appliance is pumped up for an erection and a release valve is pressed to eliminate the erect state again cylinders are filled with fluid to develop an erection this device is promoted as providing the most natural look and feel has more fluid being sent through the cylinders to produce a firmer erection cause the least amount of pain and discomfort and is least likely to cause penis tissue deterioration with all of these devices the individual will never again be able to have a natural occurring erection my recommendation is to search out the most competent urologic surgeons and review the number of procedures performed and their patient satisfaction rate this process is best accomplished through internet searches some urologists hold regular classes for men interested in having the surgery completed at these sessions all questions may be addressed and an opportunity to see how the devices work is usually provided choose a surgeon that treats the individual post surgically with recovery in a hospital setting for a few days some surgeries are performed as a same day procedure with possible resulting complications bleeding pain urinary difficulty being ignored additionally with the same day surgery the patient usually is catherized and must return the following day to have it removed in summary this surgery can improve the quality of both partner is lives having medical conditions such as diabetes is most likely responsible for the ed your situation will most likely not respond adequately to pills creams injections or pumps i suggest interviewing multiple urologists before deciding on the

what happens when you do not treat anemia,i think it would be helpful to understand exactly what anemia is anemia is the medical term for the inability of red blood cells to transport oxygen molecules to the tissues of the body anemia can be caused by either a lack of red blood cells such as from excessive bleeding or from a lack of hemoglobin a protein on red blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen when a person has anemia their organs muscles nerves and other tissues are not receiving enough oxygen to function well usually a person with anemia feels very run down  many people experience episodes of mild to moderate anemia due to temporary situations like heavy menstrual bleeding because this type of anemia is caused by some sort of brief episode that brings about the condition the body often can rebound by producing additional red blood cells to correct the problem sometimes however anemia is caused by a long term medical condition that does not allow the body to catch up its red blood cell production an example of this type of anemia is sickle cell anemia this inherited disorder causes many red blood cells to be malformed and unable to transport oxygen this is not a situation the body can correct by making more cells so to answer your question untreated anemia can have a serious impact on a person is health depending on the cause if a person has a chronic anemia they could actually die from the disease and that would be a shame because most anemias can be managed with medications and supplements if you have anemia or know someone you think may have it i suggest you visit a health care practitioner for a simple blood test and treatment wishing you well
for over a year my urine has smelled of sulphur,they are both the same or at least chemically equivalent singulair is the brand name  montelukast is the generic name they can be used interchangeably in treating allergies i was on singulair for about 15 years without any effects to my liver my normal yearly physical exams include blood work and my liver numbers were always in the normal range in the summer of 2012 my insurance decided to change my singulair prescription to montelukast because it is cheaper how nice of them  everyone said it is the same exact thing as singulair but for some reason i was apprehensive and just did not trust this new medicine in february 2013 i had my yearly physical and my liver numbers had sky rocketed way beyond the normal ranges they look at 2 numbers ast and alt even though i am not a heavy drinker the doctor had me stop all alcohol for 6 weeks and then i was retested the results were exactly the same as before so alcohol was not the culprit the doctor wanted to send me to the hospital for additional tests including to check for hepatitis to see why i was exhibiting liver damage i asked if i could try fasting from montelukast for 6 weeks first before undergoing a bunch of other tests and the doctor agreed because he said i was not in danger however he did not think montelukast was the cause i had a feeling it was montelukast because nothing else had changed in the last few years other than that after 6 weeks of not taking montelukast i was retested and my liver numbers dropped by half my ast was back in the normal range and my alt was just above the high normal which is nothing to worry about therefore i was right it was the montelukast that was causing my liver damage this medication may be cheaper but it is more detrimental to me physically and is not worth the savings to me they are similar but are not exactly the same supposedly the active ingredients are the same but the inactive ingredients are different i have been on singular a year and recently switched over to the now available eqivalent montelukast i have noticed an increase of sweeting and tiredness since switching over to the generic i am going to stop taking the med for a few days to see if it is the new generic that is causing my symptoms or something else has anyone else experienced these symptoms since switching to montelukast i have just been changed over without notice when i was on singulair i hardly used my inhalers and didnt wake at night been on these montelukast for about a week and i am waking at night to use my inhaler and using it more often through the day which i wasnt before i would like to know the same thing i have tried to use the montelukast 2 times now and

i had a cyst removed on my neck i was diagnosed with a c diff infection,currently there are no drug interactions found between levothyroxine and omeprazole however this does not mean that interactions cannot exist it is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products omeprazole should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal levothyroxine should be taken 30 minutes to one hour prior to a meal they can be taken together with water on an empty stomach if needed the previous answer is not only false but can lead to very serious health implications co administration of omeprazoleother ppisacid reducersetc along with thyroid meds whether for tsh t4 or others can cause a drastic decrease in absorption of the thyroid medication there are many peer reviewed studies that prove this all one needs to do is a proper google search or a subscription to any of the popular medical journals your stomach needs an acidic environment to properly convert your thyroid medication into a usable medication to get into your bloodstream and if you take an acid reducer with your thyroid med this can cause problems if you must take both as i personally do because of my tsh levels reaching 24 6 plus ulcers and cancerous polyps due to gerd make sure you take your acid reducing medication at least 4 hours before your thyroid medication no matter what kind it is and make sure not to take another acid reducing medication at least 4 hours after your thyroid med if you do not separate the acid reducers 4 hours before and 4 hours after your thyroid medication your thyroid levels will become unstable and you will need to adjust your dosage but in order to prevent your levels from getting out of whack and potentially causing more harm just separate your meds as posted above and you should have no issue the above answer telling you that it is okay to take at the same time is incredibly harmful do not take my word for it someone who has been dealing with both issues for a decade trust the scientists that have figured this out through multiple peer reviewed studies just a few sources proving the point of my previous answer after 2 minutes of google searches wow was that previous post really posted by a doctor i feel bad for their patients <link> <link> <link> <link>

i have heard conflicting opinions 7 weeks of pregnancy what should my wife avoid eating and drinking  we just had our first appointment and the md said it was ok for her to have caffeine sushi and a drink as long as it was in moderation thoughts,i tend to go with what the expert tells me whether it is an md or a quantum physicist because they have far greater training and expertise in their fields than i do if your ob doc says it is ok for your wife to have caffeine sushi and a drink then i would tend to rely on that advice however the larger issue here is when is it appropriate to question a physician the answer anytime it is not unusual to leave the doctor is office and later feel conflicted or unsettled by what you have been told and it is perfectly fine to call your doctor is office back to express your conflicted feelings and ask for clarification doctors do not mind this at least good caring doctors do not if you want to be perfectly safe your wife can err on the side of caution and avoid caffeine sushi and alcohol just because the doctor said she could consume them does not mean she must consume them make sense best wishes with the pregnancy hi the best thing is to live your life as normal relax and enjoy yourselves this way you will get pregnant the only time you need to watch things are if your having problem with either of your health is and told to leave certain foods alone but just enjoy and take things in moderation hope this helps you good luck hi i am very sorry got the bit about being so pregnant wrong this is what comes of answering late at night but as you are pregnant its still the same answer take things in moderation as they say been there and done that brought up 3 kids all very healthy now with there own kids who have kids yes makes us great gran parents gave them the same advice just take life as it comes and when your pregnant look after yourselves do not over do things good luck

what are some exercises that i can do while traveling without carrying any equipment,you can do lunges and stair climbing for your legs no external resistance just your own body weight if you have someone to hold you by the legs you can do back extensions by lying on your belly with your torso off the bed and lift your back up you can also just do this lying on the floor then you will not need anyone to hold you for lats you can lie down on the floor bring your arms up in front of you elbows on the floor and press down trying to lift your torso off the floor that will work lats you can also do chair dips they will work your lats a little it can be more difficult to exercise while traveling but it is certainly still attainable here are some ideas and suggestions for ways that you can get exercise while traveling • there are plenty of different body weight exercises calisthenics or stretches that you can do in your hotel room here is a great list of exercises that do not require equipment <link> • many hotels have onsite fitness rooms or swimming pools that you may have access to • try to find nearby parks or ways to get involved in recreational activities outdoors • go for a walk or run outside or do stair climbing • resistance bands require little space so they can be packed easily and be used in a hotel room • if you are bringing a laptop you can bring an exercise dvd to use in your hotel room if you do not own an exercise video you can search for free ones to watch online be unconventional and think outside of the box if necessary if it is still a challenge for you to do exercise while traveling make it a point to be more diligent by doing exercise on days where you have more control of your environment or try to plan your exercise around travel as best as possible

could i be pregnant i have been on paragaurd for 3 years i recently change the way i eat with no meat and it is been a month and now my period has not came i am not irregular in my periods i want to kno why it has not came i even had symptoms of being on my period and still no blood,hi cant find any info why but did find this on medhelp see if you think it helps you i just wanted to explain how the copper t works for those of you that do not know i found out of this out by doing my own research through several different places because usually a dr will not explain everything to you or they do not explain in a way you can understand first off there is a reason it is called a copper t the iud is made of copper and shaped like a t the reason is made of copper is because copper actually kills sperm the fluids inside your body kill a lot of sperm the moment it is introduced the copper helps to kill the rest it is shaped like a t because the top part of the is attached to your uterus where an egg would typically attach itself that way even if your fluid and the copper did not kill all the sperm and an egg did get fertalized it usually will not attach to the uterine wall it is possible for the egg to attach to another part of the uterine wall but is unlikely and usually when this happens there is a miscarrage miscarriage becuase the fetus cannot receive what is need through it is location this all contributes to why it is more likely to have an eptopic pregnancy while you have an iud if the egg cannot attach to the uterine wall sometimes it will attach to the folopian tube eptopic pregnancy this can be very dangerous and needs to be taken care of right away although an eptopic pregnancy is more likely with women that have an iud that does not mean it is going to happen the copper t along with your body kills almost of the sperm and in most women even if an egg does get fertalized if it cannot attach to the right spot on uterine wall usually it is simply discharged when you get your period i know it can still be scary even though i have all this information i am still scared when i am late but the less you stress about it the quicker you will get your period if you truly are not pregnant hope it helps in some way good luck

will calcium supplement help to heal broken bones faster what will speed the healing  2 broken bones in the right hand of my sixteen year old son the break is vertical so less likely to shift,i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster after all bones are made of calcium right so feeding them calcium should speed up healing unfortunately that is not how it works unless you have a pre existing calcium deficiency not likely in an otherwise healthy 16 year old boy taking calcium will not help your bones heal the process of bone healing is called remodeling  your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place this process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule for common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes 6 to 8 weeks unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out what will help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture resting the hand to keep the fractures stable will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal wishing you well this answer is true most fractures especially of bigger bones will take 6 to 8 weeks smaller bones like those of the fingers andor wrist will only take 4 5 weeks just gotta baby them the body is made to heal itself just let it
i have debilitating shoulder pain acupuncture physio and doctors may have caused permanent damage,in my opinion first step is to do a nerve conduction velocity to determine id damage is permenant or you can wait 3 weeks for wallerian degeneration to occur and further 1 day for every milimeter length of your arm second physical therapy should focus on streching the upper shoulder capsule and strengthening your arm depressors like latismus dorsi  exercise like resisted exercise in flextion and abduction will make problem worse physical therapy can be helpfull if your physical therapist understands body biomechanicsgood luck

do i have lupus or some chronic viral infection,i get asked all the time as a pharmacist about vitamin supplements and other items come and talk to the pharmacist first in most cases the pharmacist is going to ask you if you are seeing a doctor or obgyn most likely they are going to put you on a prescription vitamin there are specific formulations made just for pregnant women they cover a good amount of the vitamins and also include things like iron calcium and folic acid these are very important and not only for the mom but for the baby as well and help in development of their spine and their brain so really important that pregnant moms understand that they need to get special vitamins made just for them now you want to be careful and make sure that while you are taking these prenatal vitamins that you are not taking additional vitamins on top of it you could actually take too much of certain vitamins and that may cause some problems down the road so let your pharmacist know everything that you are taking including over the counter herbal and vitamins the herbal category is an area that i would definitely avoid while you are pregnant we just do not have any studies or data to know whether or not it is going to harm mom or baby so better to be safe than sorry as far as medications over the counters come and ask the pharmacist if you have certain things like an upset stomach there are some products that are available and can be used in pregnant women but you really need to talk to us first as far as prescription medications there are many different products that a pregnant mom can take and by the pharmacist and physician or healthcare provider working together we can make sure that you are on the right ones once again if you have any questions come and talk to us with the medication experts

can a person go off high blood pressure medication if he looses weight or is this a lifetime medication once started,when a person becomes overweight they make it harder for their heart to function think about it every pound of extra fat requires extra blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the cells as your heart works extra hard to pump blood through possibly miles of extra blood vessels it can cause high blood pressure when a person who is overweight loses weight the opposite effect can occur the fat and extra miles of blood vessels have gone away with the weight loss so the heart does not have to pump as hard this can lower blood pressure so yes if a person is overweight and takes high blood pressure medication they may be able to get themselves off the meds by losing weight i say may because factors other than extra weight may be causing the individual is hypertension problems if you are overweight and taking medication for high blood pressure you should consult your physician before you begin a weight loss program that way your healthcare provider can monitor your progress and adjust your medications as you lose weight no one should ever stop taking a medication like one for high blood pressure on their own that definitely could have bad consequences wishing you well

i am about to get intimate with a guy for the first time really nervous about hiv and other nasties what shd i do  i am a male 25 years old never had sex with a man before i met this amazing guy online and we immediately connected i am not aware of his sexual history i am meeting him soon and i do not want to offend him in any way but we have a mutual urge to have sex kindly help,remember this your first duty is not to him it is to you so do not worry about offending this man if he is offended that you want to have safe sex then he is not a person you want to have sex with in the first place but there is a larger issue here why do you want to have sex with a man you know only from online exchanges would not it be better to develop something of an in person relationship before hopping in the sack people can say all sorts of lovely sexy things online but you can not see how they interact with friends treat their mother speak to the waitress handle their liquor treat their pets all things that speak volumes about a person is character without having met in person and gone out together a few times you can not see if details this fellow told you about his life match up when you see it in reality does he actually live in apartment 5 like he said does he actually drive a mercedes or does it turn out he actually drives an 1980 chrysler k car how do you know this person is safe    and i do not mean sexually how do you know he will not lure you into a situation where he drugs rapes and robs you i am trying to exaggerate the possibilities here in order to help you see having sex with this man may not be the best thing for you to do maybe you should slow down for a moment and consider getting to know this guy first even if you are not interested in a relationship  per se having casual sex with another man puts you into a high risk category for contracting hiv and other stds you should at least get to know this guy well enough to be able to discuss your sexual histories if you are not comfortable enough to do that i would argue you have no business having sex with him but if you choose to proceed anyway make sure you both wrap it up used properly a condom offers protection from contracting hiv and certain other stds however a condom does not necessarily protect you against herpes or genital warts be careful my friend wishing you well

can panick attacks happen only during taking a test in school  my daughter  22 saying that everythime she is going to take a test at school she feels panicked and forgets all the materials that she studied it is been going on for 4 years is she having a panic attack,it might be related to your birth control assuming you just started it many people have stomach problems as a side effect to starting new medications a doctor can sometimes prescribe a different medicine for the same purposecondition as different medications even for the same condition can have different fewer or sometimes worse side effects it is also very possible that you are simply not eating enough before bed causing you to wake up to a more palpable hunger in the morning i know from personal experience this can vary based on what your normal eating habits are how soon you go to bed after you eat and any recent dietary changes you might have made if you have recently started or stopped a new diet or exercise style or program it can take a while for your body to readjust since you do not seem to have any other problems and the pain goes away after you eat something it is unlikely to be anything serious or unmanageable and i highly doubt you are pregnant since you use two types of birth control your regular physician can probably help you out if you are really worried or nothing seems to help or change though

how are patients with viral hemorrhagic fever treated,first of all i want to make sure that [everyone] knows about our new web site which is healthcare gov which gives very specific information about plans available in the marketplace after the first of october we will have pricing information along with those plans but for the first time ever we have pulled together all the information by zip code by age by health status of what is available in both the public market and the private market and that is a really good tool to go to over [and] over and over again i would say before you cancel anything and try to rebook you need to know what your company is going to do with your plan a lot of companies are picking up these additional benefits you need to price the alternative but the good news is our actuaries have told us that the new benefits will likely only cost between one and two percent in terms of premium increases and we have really called on insurance commissioners and others to take a careful look at high rates that are being charged by companies to make sure that they relate directly to health benefits that people are getting
what is imrt,for many years standard radiation therapy involved large machines focusing huge beams of radiation at the prostate or whatever the target organ was and where those beams all overlapped is where the damage was done the problem with that was the surrounding tissues were damaged and sometimes tissues and organs in the vicinity could not tolerate the radiation so the dose to the cancer was not high enough over the past several years they developed a technique called imrt which stands for intensity modulation radiation therapy instead of large beams that focus on the tumor there are computer generated pencil sized beams that almost paint the organ so you can get much higher doses with thousands of little microbeams with killing doses on the cancer but the tissues surrounding the cancer get minimal doses so there is fewer side effects much higher success at killing the cancer

can poison ivy rash return same place after 2 months  rash returned same places on arms after 2 months since had first rash  have not been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy any one ever hear of this happening,so i see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can and who is right absolutely the people who say it can return are right last summer i had poison ivy around my ankles many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned i was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything i had used outdoors i was not working outdoors at all moreover even now a year later though i do not have the rash around my ankles if i scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return currently i am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neck  unrelated to last year is episode i have taken prednizone for a week and never again will i take a stereoid no wonder all those nfl players are killing people i have washed all my clothes sheets etc in hot water twice the rash on my face has almost disappeared but i have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back but i have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks the poison ivy  as someone else said  is surely in my system i wish i could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant would not look for answers and receive erroneous ones from so called professionals what has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar it stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching i apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and i wait for it to dry naturally then i rub itch all over the now dry area there may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs hideous but effective the scabs fall off fairly soon so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall ugh gross  i have been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the itch and rub some in  whereas last year using other treatments i could not sleep other treatments  vick is vapo rub clorox so good for your liver cortizone creams and other over the counter meds have not done so well have not tried tobacco but i am an x smoker and if there is anything that makes me want to smoke it is lying awake all night scratching  so i had to forget that a pox take the next creep who writes that the best treatment is avoidance  i hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once the plant is everywhere  i hope this helps some other poor sufferer itchy scratchy

26 yrs m 60kg 172cm problem i lose weight if i do not do exercise i have always been a thin person i have gastritis not severe i do not do so much exercise not regularly but i tend to lose more weight if i stop doing exercise which i think is abnormal because other people gain weight when they do not do exercise i want to know what could be the cause i think my diet and way of living is normal,you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment some co existing conditions such as mild depressiondemoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated however some stimulants may make anxiety or depression worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy cbt have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxietyself esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and obgyn and wean off any stimulant treatment

40 yr male sex with massage girl once with condom what was my risk paranoid about hiv and stds what tests to take  i am just paranoid about that one encounter 2 wks ago i was wearing a condom and did not see any visible ulcers or warts on her i know that does not necessarily mean she has no stds i want to know what my risks were and what tests should i get hsv hpv etc  please advise thank you,condoms are good protection not perfect of course for certain types of stds like herpes or hpv but pretty good having sexual relationships with a prostitute the real name for your massage girl certainly increases your risk but since you are not showing any signs of an std in the last two weeks it is your fear and anxiety and perhaps a little guilt that is driving you crazy see a medical provider and be perfectly honest and open about the details do not be embarrassed be up front have a good examination and a bank of screening tests for the most common stds sometime later your doctor will tell you when you may need to repeat those tests to be extra sure there is no way to determine specific risks since you do not know the std status of this prostitute they tend to get tested quite frequently too since passing on stds are bad for the massage business she is conducting you were sold a happy ending but i hope in your case the happy ending does not result in sad consequences
i had a horseback riding accident and fell on my back pain is spreading,it is impossible to say because every individual is system clears alcohol at its own rate as well the overall length of time it takes for a person is body to clear metabolize a given amount of alcohol is related to how much alcohol is in the person is system in general the average person is body metabolizes alcohol at a certain rate per hour let is say you are an average man and have had two beers perhaps your blood alcohol content measures 0 02 it would probably take about 90 minutes for that alcohol to be completely cleared from the system or let is say you had more to drink than that let is say you had several shots of whiskey over the course of a few hours raising your blood alcohol level to 0 10 which constitutes a level of legal intoxication in many u s states it could take over six hours for that alcohol to get out of your system quite a difference right these examples are hypothetical factors that affect how a person is body metabolizes alcohol include their sex weight whether or not they have liver problems whether or not they are drinking on an empty stomach and much more wishing you well it is difficult to say how long alcohol stays in the body alcohol metabolizes more quickly in individuals with a high tolerance to alcohol on the other hand it will take longer to metabolize in someone with a lower tolerance females metabolize alcohol much slower than males another consideration is body weight a higher body weight will contribute to a higher tolerance and faster metabolism   while a lower body weight will often times result in a slower metabolism take into account the overall health of the individual alcohol metabolism would certainly be affected in someone with liver disease gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855 338 6929

can kidney stones store hydromorphone drug test shows positive for hydromorphone the last time i had hydromorphone was about 6 months ago for my kidney stones,most of the factors that lead to the development of hernias are beyond the control of the individual some of those factors are inherited and develop as the individual grows the arrangement of the local tissues and their thickness and strength may greatly affect the relative risk of developing a hernia over a lifetime however that risk can be increased by failure to use good body mechanics when lifting poor abdominal support posture and weight control problems

my testosterone level is a 9 yet my doctor did not recommend injections what is going on,testosterone is the major male hormone there are three different types of blood tests that can be used to measure testosterone levels so the first step in understanding your level is to find out which test was used and the normal range for men in your age group total testosterone is the most common test used it measures all the testosterone in your blood a typical range for men over 19 is 240 950 ngdl but the results vary depending on the lab used you can also measure free testosterone free testosterone is a measure of the testosterone that is not bound to proteins in the blood a typical range for men is 9 30 ngdl obesity affects the level of sex hormone binding proteins so your doctor may order a free testosterone level if you are obese historically it was thought that only free testosterone was able to exert hormonal effects we now know that testosterone bound to the protein albumin can also exert effects bioavailable testosterone measures this level bioavailable testosterone varies depending on the age of the man for a man in his 20 is the normal range of bioavailable testosterone would be 83 257 ngdl but for a man in his 60 is it would be 40 168 ngdl normal ranges differ depending on the laboratory used so be sure to discuss with your doctor what is the appropriate normal range for the lab where the test was done if your testosterone level is low it is important to re test the level to determine if a lab error or just a daily variation has occurred the amount of testosterone varies at different times of the day so this is a blood test that needs to be repeated before making medical decisions it is always important to make sure lab tests correlates with your symptoms low testosterone levels in men causes decreased sexual desire erectile dysfunction and infertility however testosterone also has other important functions it affects behavior muscle mass and bone density therefore a man with low testosterone can develop osteoporosis finally in understanding testosterone levels your doctor needs to determine whether the root of the problem is a result of a problem in the testicles where testosterone is produced or if there is a problem in the part of the brain that controls the production of testosterone measuring lh and fsh hormones produced in the pituitary of the brain will help make that distinction once this information is available your doctor can decide how you need to be treated testosterone replacement in the form of a patch gel or injection is usually given but as with all medications there are cautions testosterone can increase the size of the prostate and may cause worsening symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy and aggravate prostate cancer so talk with your doctor to understand your test and his concerns

what are some cheaper alternatives to plastic surgery for youthful skin,yes i am a facial cosmetic surgeon and still make patients happy with eyelid and facelifts neck lifts and chemical wrinkle removal but for those on a tighter budget cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists can now give you some real bang for your non surgical bucks here is my shortlist of the three best things you can do for that healthy younger and youthful look 1 retin a retin a a derivative of vitamin a should be thought of as a vitamin too the skin is own potent and unique vitamin if you will take “one a day” if you will a nighttime application of just a pea sized amount of retin a available also as the generic retinoic acid followed by application of a moisturizer another favorite and winner see below will go a long way to make your skin smoother and free of minor blemishes including some of those nasty brown spots age spots an important long term benefit of retin a is that it thickens the outer layer of the skin and that is important thicker skin resists wrinkling retin a is available only by prescription it comes in various strengths consult your dermatologist or cosmetic plastic surgeon for more information and advice on use and remember for the optimal results use it every day do not quit 2 moisturizer + sunscreen summer is here    we need to get serious about sun protection particularly if you live in southern ca south texas or south florida in those hot spots the sun is strong and therefore not your skin is best friend there are many excellent moisturizer sunscreen combinations on the market and do not equate cost with excellence the pricier ones have the big ticket to pay for all the marketing and advertising what spf sun protection factor number should you use the number scale was developed to indicate potency relative to elapsed time of use divide the spf number by four to get the number of hours the product is expected to be effective the only problem with such a general formula is that it does not take into account how heavy the application and what factors might cause the protection to be dissipated such as by sweating or water sports best advice pick a mid strength product say spf 30 reapply every 2 3 hours and you cannot go wrong remember a little sun is ok nature intended us to get some sun to produce the essential vitamin d but benefits diminish and negatives begin to appear after even just 20 minutes during the summer so be conservative with your sunbathing 3 botox cosmetic or dysport [everyone] has heard about or has used botox dysport is its new competition practitioners vary in their preference but do not worry you cannot go wrong with either botox has long proven its safety and value for the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows those horizontal forehead lines and the squint or crow is feet just aside

when ever i seat in group of people they will experience blocked noses atleast two or more i bath three times in day change my clothes all time and dont use body lottions,it started a few years ago when there was a flu shot shortage no flu shot for me that year i thought to myself “i do not want the miserable flu what can i do ” that is when i became a bathroom contortionist i knew that if i got the flu i was likely to give it to myself you do not usually get the flu from someone else you give it to yourself while someone coughing or sneezing in your face could certainly do it thankfully that does not happen very often you are more likely to get the flu from yourself you touch something that someone with the flu has touched then you touch your nose or mouth and you are infected flu viruses can live on surfaces for several hours – up to 24 hours on hard nonporous surfaces  you need to take steps not to infect yourself since not touching your nose and mouth is very difficult the best approach is to keep those hands clean here is my bathroom contortionist routine first i wash my hands and no just getting your hands wet does not count in order to get those clingy flu viruses off your hands you need to wash with soap and water rubbing your hands together vigorously ideally for at least 20 seconds but if you are going to skimp on the time do not skimp on the scrubbing the dirty truth about hand washing here is where so many people go wrong even if you get your hands good and clean the key is to not dirty your hands again even before making your way out of the bathroom you have to figure out how to get a towel to dry your hands without touching anything but that towel this might take some preparation make sure the towel is already available before washing your hands or break out the contortionist in you use your elbow to get the paper towel out of the dispenser since it is tough to get your elbow to your nose to infect yourself that way it is a pretty safe approach now to the faucet hopefully the faucet turned itself off if not hopefully you did not turn it off with your hands if so start all over because a team of germs just jumped back on board turn the faucet off with the paper towel from this point forward the towel is your hand on your way out the door push the door open with something other than your hand your butt elbow foot – pick your body part but i do not recommend your head or if you have to pull the handle to open the door just make sure only the towel touches the door then i open any other doors with the towel and then toss it in the trash when i get back to my office i am back in my office with squeaky clean germ free hands lastly

why is it that the medical profession is so behind the times when it comes to considering the feelings of husbands as it pertains to their wive is medical care i just recently learned about the exams my wife has been subjected to on a yearly basis at least one of the following pelvic exam pap smear breast exam it depresses and angers me that a male physician can perform those exams without my consent meanwhile the same doctor over the course of more than 10 years has never asked me to remove anything more than my shirt while she is asked to strip down every time she sees him i think without the consent of both partners in a marriage that it should be illegal for an opposite sex health care professional to perform invasive exams of this nature we are not talking about an emergency here and i feel that he has caused irreparable damage to our marriage and has taken something from me that i can not ever get back what is your take on this,your doctor is being thorough trying to give you a more definite answer based on the results of both tests there is always a cause to be concerned so your doctor is trying to alleviate any diagnostic uncertainty as a breast cancer survivor i can share what i have learned from my experiences i am not a medical professional i can only give my opinions mammograms do not always detect everything but they have a very important role to play in diagnostics dense breast tissue most often will obscure many things during mammography therefore many doctors will order an ultrasound or mri each of these diagnostic tools have unique strengths that play vital roles in proper diagnoses it seems you are in great hands and that your doctor is doing everything possible to rule everything out without causing delay which would only increase your anxiety i believe in prevention in all things i believe in early detection saves lives most lesions turn out to be cysts however should a different type of lesion be found the sooner the better if it should turn out to be cancerous the earlier it is found diagnosed and treated then better the outcome also the earlier a tumor is diagnosed the easier the treatment mammograms do save lives i found my tumor myself through self exam i have a very aggressive form of breast cancer which grows very quickly so the lump formed and grew large quickly between my annual mammograms my diagnosis triggered my sister getting her first mammogram through which two tumors were found mammography saved her life mammography also brings relief and joy two days ago i underwent my latest mammogram and two years post diagnosis i am cancer free
what vegetables and fruits help fight cancer and heart disease,celery green peppers thyme    and chamomile tea    all contain a phytochemical that research suggests has strong anti inflammatory action plant components phytochemicals appear to have the ability to protect us from harmful inflammation which can increase the risk of cancer heart disease and insulin resistance additional clues about how plant compounds help prevent cancer and other disease have been revealed thanks to a series of studies from the western human nutrition research center in davis calif the researchers are careful to point out that several key questions still need to be answered such as are the compounds as effective in humans as they are in lab cultured cells what amounts of the phytochemicals do our bodies actually absorb and use from the foods we eat the six plant compounds that the researchers specifically investigated because they are thought to act as anti inflammatory agents are luteolin quercetin chrysin eriodicytol hesperetin and naringenin here are a couple of the phytochemical discoveries * the six phytochemicals studied were shown to inhibit a particular enzyme is ability to activate a biochemical signal that leads to inflammation * luteolin was the most effective inhibitor of the pro inflammatory enzyme luteolin can be found in celery thyme green peppers and chamomile tea foods rich in quercetin include capers apples and onions oranges grapefruit lemons and other citrus fruits are good sources of hesperetin eriodicytol and naringenin consider this another good reason to add more fruits and vegetables to your everyday diet

what should i look for on a social networking health site,brian loew founder and ceo of the health and wellness social networking website inspire com suggests that consumers should consider the following when going online for support around a health condition not all sites are the same think about what you want from an online community and understand that different sites will offer you different types of connections communities that develop on social networking sites like facebook or linkedin for example are broad in scope and gather a group of people who simply know each other within niche communities on the other hand    those developed on the basis of a shared medical condition    the conversations tend to be deeper in nature with members talking about specific symptoms treatments and the emotional impact of dealing with illness look for moderators it is best to avoid communities that do not use moderators moderators are online to essentially enforce the rules of the road they keep an eye out for any behavior that smacks of bullying personal attacks or hate speech as well as other forms of bad behavior such as selling ads there are hot button issues within certain communities that must be monitored and stopped if they appear in order to keep the experience safe for all members avoid anonymity you want to join a community that allows you to modify your privacy settings but not one that allows total anonymity the reason it is much easier for people to say hurtful or inappropriate things when they are not held accountable that does not mean you should be required to make your real name public however
can marajuana help dementia,several genes have now been definitively linked to parkinson is disease the first to be identified was alpha synuclein in the 1990s researchers at the national institutes of health nih and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large italian family and three greek families with familial parkinson is disease and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene they found a second alpha synuclein mutation in a german family with parkinson is disease these findings prompted studies of the role of alpha synuclein in parkinson is disease which led to the discovery that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinson is disease contained clumps of alpha synuclein protein this discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease researchers studying inherited parkinson is disease discovered that the disease in one large family was caused by a triplication of the normal alpha synuclein gene on one copy of chromosome 4 this triplication caused people in the affected family to produce too much of the normal alpha synuclein the study showed that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in parkinson is disease just as the abnormal form does other genes linked to parkinson is disease include parkin dj 1 pink1 and lrrk2 parkin dj 1 and pink 1 cause rare early onset forms of parkinson is disease the parkin gene is translated into a protein that normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins dj 1 normally helps regulate gene activity and protect cells from oxidative stress pink1 codes for a protein active in mitochondria mutations in this gene appear to increase susceptibility to cellular stress lrrk2 which is translated into a protein called dardarin was originally identified in several english and basque families and causes a late onset form of parkinson is disease subsequent studies have identified this gene in other families with parkinson is disease as well as in a small percentage of people with apparently sporadic parkinson is disease researchers are continuing to investigate the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinson is disease develops they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinson is disease but the nature of these links is not yet clear

vaginal opening  tissue growing back together my daughter is 5 years old and has been having some trouble with the skin of her vagina opening growing back together the one nurse practitioner prescribed estrogen after using this a few times i noticed the tissue began to separate gain several months later this problem seem to happen again so we went back and saw a doctor this time he was completely against using estrogen because of the side effects what can we use that will help with this problem,i agree with the nurse practitioner using tiny amounts of estrogen cream just on the areas that are adherent is safe and highly effective there are little or no side effects if you use this hormonal ointment sparingly and periodically many of my patients with labial adhesions need to use it again and again to control this very common problem \ soon your little girl 4 or five more years will be making her own estrogen and it will not likely be an issue

can eating chalk harm my baby or stop me from getting pregnant,this is a very interesting question that makes me wonder if you are from the piedmont area of georgia where chalk eating is not uncommon among african american women probably the most concerning aspect of chalk eating in terms of pregnancy is the possibility of becoming anemic anemia is a condition that occurs when your blood lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen being pregnant makes a woman more susceptible to anemia as it is let alone adding in chalk eating to possibly make you even more susceptible some anemias can be caused by vitamin b deficiencies including folate folic acid  which could indeed harm a fetus i do not know if chalk eating contributes to vitamin b deficiency anemias or not another side effect of chalk eating is constipation while this will not affect your chances of conceiving constipation can make pregnancy more uncomfortable than it needs to be short answer if you are trying to conceive or are already pregnant give up the chalk eating at least until after your baby arrives best wishes to you

my daughter will eat nothing for days and will eat alot in 1 day then not eat for days agian what is going on  along with that when i tell her to eat something she replies food is disgusting,i am not sure what you mean by days without food  if she eats absolutely nothing for 3 4 days and then finally eats one day that would be problematic you need to make sure her growth is on track by checking with her pediatrician if she eats very few foods and tends to gag or choke a lot then have her evaluated by a feeding therapist speech or ot to rule out oral motor or sensory issues this also might be a sign of an eating disorder    for signs and symptoms see this post if you suspect an eating disorder get her help right away if she is young and picks at food for a few days and then eats quite a bit that is more normal especially if growth is on track the best way to handle this is to provide balanced meals and snacks at regular intervals and make sure she sits for a period of time 10 15 minutes do not pressure her to eat and let her know she does not have to    but she does have to sit and join everyone at the table children tend to eat better with a non pressure approach feeding pushing children to eat can cause early fullness and less food intake at meals if there is any doubt take her in to the pediatrician for a double check good luck

can my partner of 7 months get herpes if i have no present out break since  i was diagnosed with genital herpes in 2003 and had only one visible outbreak since then i have never seen any visible outbreaks or any signs of it my partner of 7 months would get it if i never had no outbreaks but had unprotected sex,you would have to see a neurologist just to know if you had any diazepam related brain damage i do not know the details of your medication use if you are having any neurological issues that you attribute to brain damage it may not be related at all to your past use of this medication some parts of the brain recover nicely other parts do not so it would be impossible for any medical provider to blindly delve into your case to such details over the internet

what is yellow snow,hair on the upper lip tends to be a genetic and also hormonal pattern so you should have an evaluation to make sure that there are no hormonal alternations so if you have gone on or off oral contraceptives that can be a cause behind it otherwise you can treat it and laser hair removal is probably the most effective treatment to do electrolysis is also very effective but even these two treatments in an area on the face such as the upper lip tends to not be permanent and you will have to do maintenance treatments over time shaving and plucking are fine shaving will not make your hair coarser in the long run although it will appear and feel coarser because the tip of the hair will have a different shape and it will feel rougher to the skin as it grows back in that will soften over time plucking is fine as well however that can cause ingrown hairs and some redness so you have to be careful there there is a cream called vaniqa that affects an enzyme that the hair follicle requires to grow and it blocks that enzyme it is kind of a reverse rogaine that way so that will help slow the hair growth so if you are plucking or shaving or doing any other hair removal treatments such as waxing or even laser plus vaniqa that might help slow that hair growth and you might get longer lasting results
what kinds of infection cause travelers diarrhea,for the most part we are talking about bacterial infections almost 90 of travelers diarrhea cases are caused by bacteria the enterotoxigenic e coli [etec strains of common bacteria that produce a toxin affecting the gut] are [the] most important cause and then there are others such as salmonella shigella campylobacter vibrio and others that are less common travelers diarrhea may also be caused by viruses such as norovirus which is in the news a lot because of how quickly it can spread through a cruise ship parasitic travelers diarrhea is yet another kind giardia intestinalis is the most common of these but there is a large number of parasites that can cause diarrhea these are less frequent

can taking lactobacillius supplement pill reduce the chances of getting bacterial vaginosis,this is a good question bacterial vaginosis bv is usually caused by a disruption of the balance between good bacteria and bad bacteria in the vagina some people use the terms good flora and bad flora to refer to bacteria  it would seem logical then that taking a supplement to help keep the vaginal flora balanced would keep bacterial vaginosis at bay the principle is the same as taking a supplement to help keep colon flora balanced in order to avoid symptoms like gas bloating and diarrhea unfortunately there is little clinical evidence that taking l actobacillus will help with bv that is because lactobacillus is a bacterium that aids in dairy digestion this is not a bacterium that normally lives in the vagina on the other hand one study showed that consuming live lactobacillus acidophilus cultures may reduce the incidence of vaginal yeast infection with the wide variety of probiotic preparations available today if you do decide to try one you should choose one with acidophilus because that bacterium does reside naturally in the vagina by the way you should not assume you have bacterial vaginosis the symptoms of bv are very similar to other conditions such as yeast infection or trichomoniasis if you have vaginal symptoms that do not clear up on their own within a few days your best bet is to see a doctor to get a real diagnosis these different conditions all require different treatments hope this helps
are there any drug interactions i should be concerned with while i am taking tessalon,tessalon is a prescription cough suppressant it can cause some drowsiness so you should avoid other medications that can make you drowsy and since it is a cough suppressant you should probably avoid other cough suppressants such as dextromethorphan if you are worried about other specific drug interactions you should talk to your pharmacist who knows all the medications you take and can help you further

is it ok to have sex while i have a uti  i was dignosed today with a uti is ok to still have sex will it make it worse or more uncomfortable,yes if you want you may have the uti because of sex in the first place so if it does not hurt to pee anymore and you are feeling better you can have sex while you are still taking the antibiotics if it hurts do not do it many women will still have the urge to urinate more often until the infection is under control remember to drink lots of fluids and be extra extra careful about your sexual hygiene most utis are caused by bacteria from your colon that somehow gets transferred to your vaginalurethral area this can happen from contaminated fingers during foreplay to a wandering penis even in a condom that gets too near your anal opening if you are having anal sex then a uti is just about guaranteed as soon as you finish having sex try to urinate to flush out your urethral area and try and drink as much as you can the next day as well keep those pipes flowing i would suggest waiting sex causes friction and the last thing you need is to add friction to infected inflamed tissues also drink a daily sugar free cranberry juice along with taking a daily cranberry supplement just make sure that your supplement is at least 500 milligrams it works i used to get them all the time but since i have been taking the supplement i have not had one in years just to clarify on the user who suggested drinking cranberry juice and taking cranberry supplements i was just at the doctor with an uti and i told him i was drinking lots of cranberry juice to get rid of the infection he told me that cranberry juice will help in preventing an uti but will not help get rid of one and the best thing to drink is lots of water at least one an hour and of course take the antibiotics prescribed my suggestion is as soon as you feel like you have a uti get to the doctors and get antibiotics before the pain increases and drink lots of water and use a heating pad what is a uti right who would want to

is a vegan diet healthy for my 3 year old son,with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher than recommended amounts adding vitamin c rich sources strawberries tomatoestomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 either fortified foods or supplements because it only occurs naturally in animal foods here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of vitamin b12 fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements iron iron fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread zinc cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas be careful with nuts which are choking hazards vitamin d fortified foods like soy milk and supplements the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who do not get enough from diet the recommended amount is 600iu omega 3 dha not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements calcium tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milkyogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan here is how grains   all natural forms of these products are vegan if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information dairy if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan it is supplied in soy milk drink it daily if you are pure vegan if you ask me animal protein can not be replaced by anything else so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3 year child

i am a virgin so how can i have chlamydia,excellent question any skin to skin contact with a person infected with chlamydia can transfer the bacteria to the uninfected partner so we may be dealing with a case of semantics here even if you have never engaged in sexual penetration the usual definition of losing one is virginity for both men and women you could get chlamydia female virgins could get chlamydia if your male partner rubbed his penis against your vulva you touched or rubbed his penis with your hand and then immediately touched your genitals he touched his own penis and then immediately touched your genitals you rubbed your genitals against those of an infected woman is you touched an infected female partner is genitals and then immediately touched yourself male virgins could get chlamydia if you rubbed your penis against the vulva of an infected female partner you touched the genitals of an infected woman and then immediately touched your penis an infected man rubbed his penis against your genitals you touched an infected man is penis and then immediately touched your own penis these are just some of the ways the chlamydia bacteria could be transferred from someone else to you without penetration being involved and when penetration oral vaginal or anal is involved it is even easier to get chlamydia i do not know of any way you could get chlamydia without engaging in some sort of intimate relations with an infected person chlamydia is not something you can pick up from a toilet seat or something like that in fact as far as i know there has never been a documented case of a anyone ever picking up a sexually transmitted disease from a toilet seat  the good news is chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics i am assuming if you have a diagnosis it means you have starting taking antibiotics already in the future be careful about the type of sex play you engage in and when you do decide to lose your virginity be sure to use a condom wishing you well

what causes your gums to bleed while you are brushing what can i do to prevent it this happens every time i brush,these products are actually commonly found in the weight loss teas and they may help a little bit in the first few days you may think that you have lost a little weight but other than that there is no proof or efficacy that they work at all and if you are allergic to things like ragweed and pollen you want to stay away from these type of products because of the dandelion component you could actually have an allergic reaction to it so once again read the labels see what is inside the product if you have any questions about it come and talk to the pharmacist because we are finding out more and more the people are getting reactions to these type of medications because of the fact that they did not know what was in it or they did not know that they were allergic to a component of it so once again keep that in mind and talk to your pharmacist doctor or healthcare provider

what genes are linked to parkinson is disease,several genes have now been definitively linked to parkinson is disease the first to be identified was alpha synuclein in the 1990s researchers at the national institutes of health nih and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large italian family and three greek families with familial parkinson is disease and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene they found a second alpha synuclein mutation in a german family with parkinson is disease these findings prompted studies of the role of alpha synuclein in parkinson is disease which led to the discovery that lewy bodies from people with the sporadic form of parkinson is disease contained clumps of alpha synuclein protein this discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease researchers studying inherited parkinson is disease discovered that the disease in one large family was caused by a triplication of the normal alpha synuclein gene on one copy of chromosome 4 this triplication caused people in the affected family to produce too much of the normal alpha synuclein the study showed that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in parkinson is disease just as the abnormal form does other genes linked to parkinson is disease include parkin dj 1 pink1 and lrrk2 parkin dj 1 and pink 1 cause rare early onset forms of parkinson is disease the parkin gene is translated into a protein that normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins dj 1 normally helps regulate gene activity and protect cells from oxidative stress pink1 codes for a protein active in mitochondria mutations in this gene appear to increase susceptibility to cellular stress lrrk2 which is translated into a protein called dardarin was originally identified in several english and basque families and causes a late onset form of parkinson is disease subsequent studies have identified this gene in other families with parkinson is disease as well as in a small percentage of people with apparently sporadic parkinson is disease researchers are continuing to investigate the normal functions and interactions of these genes in order to find clues about how parkinson is disease develops they also have identified a number of other genes and chromosome regions that may play a role in parkinson is disease but the nature of these links is not yet clear
i am scheduled this week to have a caudal injection doctor is office or surgery center,yes that would be fine
i had a surgical abortion i have concerns about my future fertility,i am not sure i completely understand your question since the main reason women take birth control is so that can have sex at the same time if you are talking about taking just one pill or your first pill on the same day you had sex this will not be an effective contraceptive as you know sex causes pregnancy if you are ovulating at the time and your partner is capable of fathering a child a woman on birth control pills really should complete a full cycle one month of the pills plus a period before using it as a contraceptive using condoms for the first month would offer good insurance
many times after eating and resuming physical work i experience general weakness shaking excessive cold sweating even though i have just eaten i also get very hungry especially for something sweet,i am sorry to hear you go through this and if it helps i will share this it happens to me too some people are just naturally prone to flushing when they are embarrassed angry or otherwise experiencing heightened emotions have you ever noticed whether or not your neck flushes for no reason at all mine does sometimes i can just be sitting around minding my own business get up to go to the bathroom and notice my neck is all red what the heck  i do not know if there is any medical explanation for this i have noticed personally that it seems to happen more in fair skinned people of north european descent it could simply be that flushing which is caused by increased blood flow just beneath the skin is more visible in fair skinned people i do not know if possible try to learn to live with this unique trait when people tease me about this i laugh right along with them i say things like some people wear their heart on their sleeve i wear my emotions on my face  if the anxiety aspect bothers you do not hesitate to seek counseling from a trained psychotherapist anxiety can be managed through cognitive therapy talk therapy and medication if warranted a counselor also can help you cope with the embarrassment you feel about the flushing i wish you all the best as a kindred spirit
what is sinusitis,do you know what to do next time your child gets a nasty cut or scrape and yes it will happen to you  rule #1 stitches need to be placed within 12 hours of the injury otherwise closing the wound increases the risk of infection so you have got to decide before the office opens the next morning rule #2 if you cannot get the bleeding under control or you can see fat or bone usually deeper than 14 inch you need to seek medical attention rule #3 cuts to the eyebrows and lipskin lines usually need stitches for the best cosmetic result since both areas have a definite line you want the two sides of the wound to have the best chance of finding each other rule #4 injuries to the mouth and lips bleed like stink but rarely need stitches all that blood flow to the area also allows the wounds to heal very quickly rule #5 if the wound is due to a human or cat bite it needs to be cleaned really well and might require antibiotics but these wounds usually do not get stitches rule #6 wounds that are getting red tender or are draining need to be seen by a medical provider rule #7 if your child is up to date on his shots he probably will not need another tetanus shot but check with your doc to be sure rule #8 sometimes staples or dermabond human superglue substance can be used instead of stitches but regardless of which method is used all wounds need to be kept clean rule #9 stitches and staples need to be removed but the length of time depends on the location of the injury the person who places them will give you specific instructions for follow up rule #10 do not freak out your child will do better with a calm parent at the helm
can a little bit of sperm get you pregnant  i am on the pill and we do use condoms before he ejaculates into me we are both wondering if i can get pregnant this way and yes i take the pill every day,only one sperm is needed to get you pregnant but if you are on the pill and consistently take it and use condoms every time you are about as safe as you can be without being completely abstinent if you are engaging in sexual play where your vagina is being exposed to any semen even before ejaculation you have a very small risk of pregnancy but remember that your birth control pills are very protective not 100 but close

is it correct that anything over an spf 25 really does not decrease uva and uvb sun exposure,while it is true that you do not double your protection when you double the spf number you do get an added benefit spf numbers are determined through testing under very controlled environments using an amount of product that no one uses in the real world by using a higher spf sunscreen and reapplying it every two hours or so you are getting closer a reasonable amount of protection i see patients every day who used sunscreen and yet they are still suntanned or sun burned which means they were not getting the spf they thought they were

i have acid reflux and wanting to know what foods to eat i know what not to intake but what would be the select foods,the primary approach to properly managing acid reflux should not be in promoting certain foods instead of others but rather in identifying and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms basically you should not focus on what to eat but rather what to avoid in that regard here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux • fatty foods • acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomato containing products • coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol • chocolate or peppermint • spicy foods i would suggest keeping a journal to write down your dietary intake daily so that you can notice trends and so that you will be able to identify potential triggers as you notice symptoms also it is recommended to refrain from lying down after a meal eating too much in one sitting or eating too quickly quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms if you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter antacid tablets or prescription medication certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux but it is more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding triggers please visit the webmd heartburngerd health center for more information

i am having burning stomach pain since i quit taking prilosec why  i stopped taking prilosec after developing severe arthritic pain in multiple joints and an xray showed thinning bones i am now having burning stomach pain mostly after eating i have switched to generic zantac but still battling the burning sensation i did wean myself off the prilosec but i am wondering if i did it too fast any help would be appreciated,i am sorry you are going through this it sounds miserable i think you need to talk to your doctor or nurse practitioner about the situation the burning sensation in your stomach clearly sounds like irritation due to excess stomach acid although both prilosec omeprazole and zantac ranitidine are marketed as treatments for gerd they work in two different ways they both block the production of excessive amounts of stomach acid but omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor  while ranitidine is an h2 antagonist  this is why one type of antacid might work better than another for individual patients in your case it sounds like omeprazole worked better than ranitidine is working for you one thing you can try while you wait to see your doctor is to take an over the counter calcium based antacid product like tums these products will not interact with the ranitidine and the calcium content will benefit your bones wishing you well

can you get chlamydia from anal sex then vaginal sex   i have been with my partner for almost 3 year he was my first and i was his first when we first became sexually active we both got tested and everything came out fine we recently went to get tested again and i came out positive with chlamydia and he did not we do have unprotected anal sex and switch to vaginal sex so my question is if he does not have it and i have never cheated could i have gotten it from having continuous unprotected anal sex,you get chlamydia from having sex with someone that has chlamydia either in their genital tract mouth or anus either one of those tests are wrong not likely or someone is not telling the truth chlamydia does not just magically develop from risky sexual activity having unprotected anal sex and then having unprotected vaginal sex is risky for infection since the rectal area is laden with intestinal bacteria germs that are not welcome in the vagina if you know in your heart that you have not had sexual activity with someone else then need i say more

could she be pregnant i would like some peace of mind  a partner and i recently engaged in mutual masturbation i ejaculated over her chest and she rubbed it in after 5 10 min she checked her vagina to see if she was still wet after another 10 15 min we got up to get cleaned up at which point she stopped and started to rub her butt on my soft penis which may or may not have still had ejaculate on it my penis was mostly between her cheeks or on her cheeks i dont think my penis made vaginal contact from behind what are the chances of pregnancy,the chance of a pregnancy is not very high this time but you are engaging in some very risky sexual behavior that could lead to a pregnancy situation in the future i suspect this will not be the last time that you engage in these activities clearly keeping a penis and sperm as far away from a vagina is the preferable practice using condoms during your sex play thus containing all of the semen or better yet have your partner get on an effective form of contraception it is only a matter of time before your mutual passion and sexual excitation will lead to intercourse then your chances are very good that an unintentional pregnancy will happen you and your partner are engaging in risky sexual activities so act like a mature person be proactive use more common sense use birth control and be very very careful

i have irregular periods and i am trying to get pregnant,in terms of weight loss the factor that is most important is the number of calories you consume vs the number of calories you burn at the end of the day if you have burned 2 000 and consumed 1 500 then you are in 500 calorie deficit if you do this for 7 days then you are in 3 500 calorie deficit and that is one pound figure that 3 500 calories = one pound if you burn 500 calories with your exercise another 300 through the rest of your activities of daily living and then 1 200 for metabolic processes to keep your heart beating organs working digesting food and other essential functions to stay alive you have burned 2 000 calories in one day if you consumed 1 500 calories that day you are in 500 calorie deficit as for exercise for the same period of time and activity you will burn more at a higher intensity if you walk on the treadmill at 4 mph for 30 minutes you will burn more than if you walk for 30 minutes at 3 mph i suggest working as hard as is comfortable without risking injury this will get you as aerobically fit as possible and being as fit as you can has advantages for weight loss because you probably will be able to do more activity exercise and activities of daily living and that will contribute to how many calories you burn all day but keep in mind that no matter how many calories you burn with exercise you still will not lose weight if you consume more calories than you burn if you burn 2 000 calories all day with exercise and all other activities but you consume 2 500 you will not lose weight and keep resistance exercise like weightlifting in mind since it helps you build muscle and muscle helps set your metabolic rate so you want as much muscle as possible

prostate cancer if you tested positive for cancer via biopsy gleason score of 6 shouldnt you see an oncologist  we have a family member diagnosed with prostate cancer via biopsy his gleason score was 6 he said the doctor told him not to worry and they would wait 6 months and test again see if it has gone up our understanding is this is the second test and it has already gone up is this normal if so why bother with the early detection if they are just going to wait till it gets worse  worried,prostate cancer can be one of the slower progressive cancers depending on the age and health status of this family member the doctor may feel that aggressive therapy surgery radiation etc  may not be appropriate at this time and wants to have some watchful waiting since i do not know the details of his case it is difficult guess at the reasons there is absolutely no reason not to have a consultation from an oncologist or have a second opinion from another urologist when it comes to these management decisions doctors are like chefs they all cook a bit differently so having some additional expert opinions can be helpful one of my best friends was diagnosed with prostate cancer two weeks ago had a complete prostatectomy this week because of his profound cancer fear only to find out that a his cancer was not as bad as they thought and b a complete prostatectomy was probably not needed had he had waited a bit longer had another opinion and did his own research he may not have jumped right to the operating room

can i do intervals inside or outside with or without exercise equipment,head lice have not killed anyone but they are public enemy number one in the school system just the mention of head lice will make you scratch i bet you are thinking about scratching your head right now head lice are just trying to survive so they find a nice person to adopt so they can feed on their blood yes head lice are vampires — they drink tiny amounts of human blood but fortunately they do not carry diseases lice mature quickly and are quite prolific in the sex department lice lay dozens of eggs nits eggs that quickly hatch in order to perpetuate their species as you read this blog lice may be drinking blood and having sex on your scalp right now now you can scratch your head it is this hysteria about head lice that drive parents and teachers crazy school systems have adopted questionable no nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp schools must have a team of nit nazis insects are taking over our world actually insects outnumber us astronomically so really we are guests in their world dogs get fleas so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them termites are eating our homes flies are landing on our dinner plate ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels kids — even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes — can get head lice i know my long haired daughter brought some home many years ago girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys i often see sesame seed sized nits on my little patients it is rare that i see a live louse scurrying around but i have seen those as well i do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well coiffed snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs “your daughter has head lice ” “what are you sure could it be something else ” “no she seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of california scalp crickets also known as the common cootie you probably have them too ” like most of the species on earth head lice have adapted to treatments which range from insecticides like permithrin products like nix malathion and sulfa antibiotics to the newly tested stromectal — a pill containing ivermectin a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs people do prefer pills to messy hair products but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill petroleum jelly mayonnaise and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice but these treatments have not been proven to be effective too bad since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or vaseline is so attractive there is a lice smothering product called ulesfia that does seem to work well as long as the peta

is it safe to lose weight when pregnant,you may have had a partial wax impaction but when you added the oil the wax softened and now you have a complete wax impaction it is very unlikely that you damaged your hearing so assuming that you do not have ear pain or other signs of an ear infection you can lavage wash out your ear canal with a gentle stream of warm water just slightly warmer than your body temperature the warm water stream will most likely dislodge the softened wax so you can do this in the shower allow a stream of shower water to go in your ear canal a hand held shower works the best once the water gets out of your ear your hearing should return to its normal level again

my labia minora are swollen with blood daktarin does not work,the affordable care act does allow insurers to charge smokers a 50 surcharge because of their tobacco use that can amount to a large increase    potentially thousands of dollars    in the cost of health insurance for smokers and the tax credits available to help lower the cost of insurance premiums cannot be applied to offset the smoking penalty however insurers do have flexibility in how this surcharge is applied and some states have banned the practice meaning insurers selling in vermont and washington dc for example will not be allowed to charge smokers more for their insurance plan you can check with your state is department of insurance to learn the law where you live in addition the law does require insurers to cover treatments that help smokers quit most employers make smoking cessation programs available as well and under the law is regulations insurers will not be allowed to charge you the full surcharge if you enroll in a smoking cessation program
can you get the flu in summer    i have all of the symptoms body aches headache dry cough    tight lungs fever goes down with aleve fatigue cold sweats my nose is not runny    i do not feel like i have a cold my daughter now has the same symptoms    does the flu go around in the summer months,most helpful answer no if there were everyone would be eating them there has always been rumors about raw oysters one of my favorite foods i ate a dozen one time and only about four of them worked just kidding an old joke people have claimed that ginseng and other herbs have the potential to enhance sexual performance but so far any studies have only been anecdotal and pure lies the biggest turn on to the opposite sex is not the food we eat but rather how we act and how well we treat them if there are aphrodisiac foods i have not heard of them

what steps can i take to a heart healthy diet,the stomach carries the heart and not the heart the stomach     miguel de cervantes i think that cervantes had it about half right it is true that what we eat directly impacts our heart health but we also rely on a healthy heart to enjoy life is pleasures which should definitely include eating good foods how we shop and prepare our food makes a huge impact on our health so what can you do to make sure you are on the right track here are three tips to get you started 1 clean out your pantry do it today and try it at least once a month go through your fridge and even that old freezer in the garage too take stock of what you have got and what you do not need focus on purging processed foods foods with trans fats and food products that contain high fructose corn syrup while throwing away food of any type is less than ideal it is important to recognize that most of these products are not real food anyway get rid of them and start fresh next time you go shopping 2 read food labels think of reading food labels as having a free dietitian at your disposal first determine what the actual serving size of your food item is supposed to be you might be amazed to learn that you have been drinking two servings of your favorite soda in one bottle or that the bowl of cereal you usually pour for yourself was meant for three second look at the trans fats listing it should read zero next look for fancy lingo on your label a good example is partially hydrogenated  which is a term that companies use sometimes to sneak small amounts of trans fats into their products finally look for foods low in sodium it turns out that processed foods provide about 80 of the sodium in our diets you can make a great improvement in your diet by choosing low sodium or sodium free options 3 outsmart the supermarket when grocery shopping have you ever wondered why you could never find a decent tomato but it is so easy to find candy bars frozen pizzas and even tabloid magazines it is called market research  supermarkets understand all too well how their customers walk through stores and how this can impact their buying habits we tend to start our shopping on the right side of the store swing around the back and then head toward the checkout line through the middle this is why so many cheap cheap from the supermarket is perspective convenience foods are in the center aisle and the candy is prominently displayed as you swipe your credit card it can be harder to find some of the healthier foods that have a lower profit margin the solution is to attentively shop from a list and to avoid any impulse purchases people do not tend to buy quinoa and
whenever i gargle be it mouthwash or tap water i am overcome with a choking feeling and end up vomiting  up until a few years ago i was an avid mouth wash user properly to point out swish gargle spit then rinse with a swish of water recently whenever i go to rinse my mouth be it with mouthwash or even tap water i am overcome with a choking sensation and i end up gagging and sometimes vomiting i am at a loss as to why the gagging and nausea sets in   no respitory issues intestinal issues fatigue fever rapid weight issues etc virtually a 1 shape,i have used mouth wash before also i also get a choking feeling and sometimes throw up a bit & it is pretty often too i think it is normal it probably happens because the mouth wash is too close to your throat in ur mouth so yeah lols
constant masturbation cause bumps on penis i damaged the skin area where the bumps seem to have formed  so i noticed a group of bumps on the shaft of penis on the right side they are not painful and there about 16 that i can see all in one area all about the same size and they do not seem to have spread a quick google search will tell me i have genital warts but i have some reservations about it because i masturbate a lot at one point i damged the skin right about where the bumps formed it was sore and i stripped it a bit i slowed down the masturbating but never completely stopped,hi mc its time to take a complete break this will give you skin time to recover i would suggest around 8 weeks if you give your body the right amount of time its a great healing and all without drugs i think you problem comes from using a grip of steel this is not the way to masturbate try using some oil like baby oil to masturbate with and try and think of the vagina and how soft it is so masturbate with a feather light touch by doing this after 8 weeks you should be ok and your spots these are just from using the grip of steel gives you far to much friction do hope this helps you good luck

my period is 3 weeks late and i feel bloated could i be pregnant  my period was due 11114 and i havent had it yet i feel bloated neasous have more headaches than normal soretender breasts and feel more tired than usual took a hpt on 11514 and it was negative a friend said it was too soon to take hpt here it is 3 weeks later same symptoms plus weird food cravings like ranch dressing mixed with ketchup and mayo advice please,there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated the idea behind the fat burning option is this because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories    from both carbohydrate and fat    because you simply do not do as much work further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range usually 60 to 85 of your maximum heart rate which is hard to do at slower speeds and fitness is ultimately what you are after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity the bottom line is that the fat burning mode probably will not be intense enough to maximize total calorie  or fat burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits
whait is the difference between 25 50 and 100mg viagra  i am 74 year old and i have erection problems i take 25mg viagra and it helps getting a strong erection but it doesnt last as soon as my partner stops stimulating me my penis loses its hardness could incrasing the dose to 50 or 100mg make a difference,no matter how much you take care of yourself eat healthy and exercise regularly there are still some health problems that may occur without you being able to stop the onset erectile dysfunction is one of such conditions it will affect your sexual ability and prevent you from achieving erections of satisfactory hardness to start and complete sexual intercourse of course erectile dysfunction is more likely to occur at older age but the sad truth is that it is not directly related to the patient is age if you have this kind of problem and would like to make sure it is resolved in no time you may consider taking viagra many people buy viagra online these days after they realize this may be the only affordable solution to their problem indeed when you compare viagra price to the price of a special surgery with a device implanted into your penis the choice becomes very clear anything that involves any kind of surgical invasion is best to be avoided if other options are available and viagra is one of those options this drug was designed for the needs of men with erectile dysfunction and you can buy such drugs online genericedmedications com

i used viagra last night for the first time with little results should i continue using it or maybe try something else,you will need to go without lipstick until your symptoms abate if you think it was a reaction do not use this one again wash your lips off carefully with mild soap and water and apply some 1 hydrocortisone ointment your lips will look shiny like vaseline but it should help that burning if i were you i would probably break open a vitamin e capsule rub it on my lips before bed and let it soak in overnight that does amazing things for healing sometimes medicated lip balms can be a real problem especially if your lips are already irritated but vitamin e oil does wonders for delicate skin like that

can i take ibuprofen after getting a flu shot,well the downside to these products is that there are side effects for example men that have certain high blood pressure disorders are taking nitrate medications if you mix these oral erection drugs with that you can drop your blood pressure and have a serious complication this is why men who take viagra levitra and cialis if after having sex they have a heart attack they have to tell the paramedics and er doctors they have this product in their systems because one of the first things the doctors will want to do is put nitrates into their blood to stabilize their heart and their blood pressure the combination can be deadly there can be some visual disorders one of the big side effects is that the drug really is not being used correctly for many men they are either not being given enough trials with it it sometimes takes several doses before it is effective they try it once and they say it is not going to work and they will go try something else the other thing is it is become very recreational a lot of guys who do not need it are taking it which raises some concerns why because it is almost become the thing to do you know you take the drug and you are guaranteed a good erection well if you had good erections before it probably will not help but it is just kind of a macho kind of a way of just kind of having fun the other concern is that for most men that have true erectile dysfunction that is a symptom of something far more serious whether it is diabetes hormone problems metabolic problems vascular disorders that is an early warning sign and by simply throwing viagra levitra cialis at them and not addressing the cause i am really doing them a lot of disservice if it is truly the first warning sign of potential coronary artery disease i mean if it is the first warning sign of coronary artery disease and you do not do the right workup the guy may get great erections but he may have a heart attack in a year or two that could have been prevented it is essential that you understand why it is you have erectile dysfunction some men just get it and that is the way that you are but you want to make sure that there is nothing serious that you are missing

i think i picked up athlete is foot fungus from the swimming pool locker room how do i get rid of it,this is a very common problem when your foot is wet and you go into an environment where it is likely that there is some fungus everywhere on the floor it is very hard to avoid so the first and the most important thing is to try to wear either flip flops or water shoes when walking as opposed to going barefoot around the pool or the locker room shower to treat it you can use over the counter antifungals to help knock the foot fungus out if that does not work then you can see a dermatologist who can even give you a prescription medication either a cream or even a pill to help clear it some people are more prone to foot fungus than others so once you have it you might be prone to getting it again over time there is also a powder that you can put into your shoe that is very absorbent that helps prevent water from accumulating which    that water moisture and dark occluded environment is just ideal for that fungus to grow so you want to create an environment that is not so fungus friendly and also treat the underlying cause and hopefully that will help keep it at bay for a long time

i have asthma and i have been taking albuterol sulfate every 2 hours is this bad what effects will it have on me,your asthma is not well controlled you should not be taking albuterol so frequently whether you are taking the albuterol via an inhaler or as a pill using it every two hours is not recommended and can cause side effects such as shakiness and an irregular heartbeat i suggest you contact your primary care provider for an appointment as soon as possible to discuss other medications to control your asthma everyone with asthma should carry a rescue inhaler such as albuterol but a bronchodilator is no longer considered the primary form of treatment for asthma on a good medication regimen you can improve your quality of life and avoid possible complications from using so much albuterol if you experience a severe asthma attack that does not improve when you use a rescue inhaler you should seek immediate medical attention by calling 9 1 1 or the emergency number wherever you are located asthma can quickly turn fatal and you must waste no time in receiving emergency treatment for an attack that does not respond to a rescue inhaler do not drive or have someone else drive you to an emergency room instead get an ambulance sent to your house so paramedics can begin immediate emergency treatment wishing you well
i am a hairdresser and the last 2 months i am experiencing painful legs constant pain,the quick answer to your question is yes your family members can take mucinex with tamiflu oseltamivir assuming none of them are allergic to the active ingredient in mucinex which is guaifenesin i am sorry to hear you have influenza raging through your family that is awful it is important to note that oseltamivir does not exactly cure the flu in fact in studies it only shortened the course of symptoms by about one day so your family members should not necessarily expect to feel better quickly when taking oseltamivir that said they should not stop taking the medication just because it does not seem effective yet they should take the whole course of oseltamivir which is usually given as one pill twice a day for five days meanwhile they should be ok to use other remedies such as acetaminophen tylenol ibuprofen motrin or over the counter cough and cold remedies to help them weather the symptoms of flu read labels carefully so you do not get overlapping drugs in various products for example do not mix two cough and cold remedies that both contain acetaminophen that is dangerous and do not overlook old fashioned chicken soup plenty of fluids and bed rest sometimes that is the only way to get over the flu if symptoms persist especially fever and congestion for more than five days it is probably a good idea to check back with the doctor if any adult spikes a high fever over 101f that is a good reason to take a trip to the emergency room next year flu shots for everyone prevention is always your best approach wishing you well

i have to force myself to eat i havent ate much in a week so far this week i have ate a half bowl of oatmeal two sandwiches and some fries and its thursday my parents are worried i think and so am i i am overweight and 13 so could it be my brain saying hey fatty stop eating any help would be much appreciated thanks,be happy of your body but also believe it is what you make of it not eating is not a reaction by your brain instead eating is encouraged in order to meet the vitamins nutrients and protein your body needs to get through the day and promotes brain functions not eating can also cause problems to the functions of your hypothalamus if there has been any new medications in your regimen maybe that is a problem i would encourage an exercise program as it has helped me in a daily routine of eating exercise is necessary among individuals whether you are overweight or not due to the release of endorphins which is food for your brain and makes you feel better i was able to trim 6 body fat in 3 months due to a steady exercise program of 6 days a week and i am even eating 5 meals a day to keep my calorie intake high i would suggest the first week starting slower with 3 days a week in order to loosen your muscles stretching is also a very important key to a successful workout in which should be done before and after the best advice is to not give up on yourself losing weight and eating healthy takes time to adjust but noticing results will help your morale and motives on a daily basis your diet is the most important thing and needs adjusting in a more strict regimen of what and when to eat if you begin exercising running for a half hour will burn roughly 300 500 calories depending on speed keep in mind that is simply a large fry from mcdonalds completely cut all of those greasy foods out and begin eating healthier to feel better boosting metabolism is a great way to start so drinking a coffee or green tea in the morning is a great way to do so no soda milk is necessary for calcium but stay away from the fats try almond milk for lower fat content and higher calcium water is a great thing to drink as it keeps you hydrated and well breakfast possible one a day for key nutrients and vitamins otherwise get cereal with vitamins and nutrients my favorite is post grape nuts which has a lot of the vitamins required for a daily intake along with protein oatmeal is also another good way to jump start your day eggs are a great breakfast food for the proteins and omega 3 lunch my personal go to is a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread greek yogurt and banana tuna fish sandwich is also a good lunch meal dinner be creative pasta and chicken that is not breaded is very good for glutamine and starch for energy quinoa is my personal favorite as it contains every essential amino acid really good cooked in chicken brother instead of water rice is another good one and i also prefer fish these foods and more such as split

what are the causes of vitamin b12 deficiency in a non vegetarian,tuberculosis can be diagnosed in several different ways including chest x rays analysis of sputum and skin tests sometimes the chest x rays can reveal evidence of active tuberculosis pneumonia other times the x rays may show scarring fibrosis or hardening calcification in the lungs suggesting that the tb is contained and inactive examination of the sputum on a slide smear under the microscope can show the presence of the tuberculosis like bacteria bacteria of the mycobacterium family including atypical mycobacteria stain positive with special dyes and are referred to as acid fast bacteria a sample of the sputum also is usually taken and grown cultured in special incubators so that the tuberculosis bacteria can subsequently be identified as tuberculosis or atypical tuberculosis several types of skin tests are used to screen for tb infection these so called tuberculin skin tests include the tine test and the mantoux test also known as the purified protein derivative test in each of these tests a small amount of purified extract from dead tuberculosis bacteria is injected under the skin if a person is not infected with tb then no reaction will occur at the site of the injection a negative skin test if a person is infected with tuberculosis however a raised and reddened area will occur around the site of the test injection this reaction a positive skin test occurs about 48 to 72 hours after the injection if the infection with tuberculosis has occurred recently however the skin test can be falsely negative the reason for a false negative test with a recent infection is that it usually takes two to 10 weeks after the time of infection with tuberculosis before the skin test becomes positive the skin test can also be falsely negative if a person is immune system is weakened or deficient due to another illness such as aids or cancer or while taking medications that can suppress the immune response such as cortisone or anticancer drugs remember however that the tb skin test cannot determine whether the disease is active or not this determination requires the chest x rays andor sputum analysis smear and culture in the laboratory the organism can take up to six weeks to grow in culture in the microbiology lab a special test to diagnose tb called the pcr polymerase chain reaction detects the genetic material of the bacteria this test is extremely sensitive it detects minute amounts of the bacteria and specific it detects only the tb bacteria one can usually get results from the pcr test within a few days

i am pregnant and going to interview for a new job will the new health insurance cover the pregnancy,doctors usually define diarrhea as a significant increase in the total weight of stool passed in a single day most people however think of diarrhea as an illness during which they have more frequent loose watery stools almost everyone has diarrhea at some point in his or her life in developing countries where illnesses that cause diarrhea are more common and where health care is less readily available diarrhea is a major health concern because of its potential to cause severe life threatening dehydration infants and the elderly are more prone to dehydration from diarrhea diarrhea that comes on suddenly and goes away over a period of a couple of weeks is usually referred to as acute diarrhea  most people with acute diarrhea recover on their own diarrhea that lasts more than four weeks is thought of as chronic diarrhea  typically chronic diarrhea requires medical care to find the underlying cause and treat complications such as dehydration

if i have pcos and i get my period on a regular basis can i still get pregnant as easily as a normal woman  my doctor diagnosed me with pcos about 1 month ago i am not sure if his diagnosis was correct because he diagnosed me purely on my physical features such as abnormal hair growth and acne i am not overweight either could my doctor is diagnose be incorrect i have my menstrual period every month my sex drive is very high as well,fever is the body is natural response to fighting off infection or inflammation fever is most prevalent as a response in the younger crowd the older we get the less often we get fevers to help us get better fever is good and should not be feared no matter what grandma told you or what you have heard fever is just a sign not a disease school authorities will exclude children since they have no idea what the child is biologically cooking if children have a contagious illness the fever stage — those first few days of an illness — would be time when they are most contagious with that said exposure to an infectious disease like a common cold or even strep does not necessarily imply that the person exposed will get it many schools and day care facilities require that a child be fever free for 24 hours before coming back to the herd this is probably a reasonable parameter but 24 hours after getting back into that classroom the child can get another viral infection and the dance will continue there are no rules that a child with one viral infection can not get another many kids especially those new to school or day care will seem to have one continuous cold lasting months in reality they have had many overlapping coalescing viral infections during this period — a new cold starting before the first one went away some fever facts * kids will be excluded from school or day care with fever period schools set their own rules whether we necessarily agree with them or not * fever in kids will cost you a lot of missed days at work period * fever is the body is normal response to fighting off an illness — a good thing it does not require treatment unless the child is uncomfortable * lowering body temperature does not shorten the course of an illness if anything it may prolong it * fevers that occur early in a viral illness are expected and should be welcomed fevers later in an illness may be a sign of a secondary infection * keep your cool fever is a sign not a disease statistically fevers in kids indicate a viral infection but not always your medical provider is your best resource to determine the significance and reason for a fever

wat can one do to treat lockjaw,lockjaw is a common term for tetanus infection if you believe you or someone you know has tetanus you need to call 911 immediately luckily tetanus is very rare in the united states due to immunization programs tetanus is caused by a bacterium called clostridium tetani that is often found in dirt soil and animal waste a person can develop tetanus from an unclean wound especially from dirty metal such as the old scenario of stepping on a rusty nail or from sharing needles when injecting illicit drugs it is important to remember to get a tetanus booster shot every 10 years as an adult to keep your immunization up to date other conditions can cause a problem that might be characterized as lockjaw  these include muscle spasms of the jaw temporomandibular joint disorders and other things however if you have any of the symptoms of tetanus notably headache trouble swallowing and you have been experienced a dirty wound shared needles with someone or have any other risk factors for developing tetanus then i urge you to seek medical attention better to discover your problem is simply mechanical or related to a temporomandibular joint disorder than to risk a tetanus infection wishing you all the best

what causes hemmoroids  the situation appears to be rather strange my wife and i developed hemmoroids at pretty much the same time she did first then i did about a month later we have now had them for several weeks she has sought medical help and got advice on hemmoroidal creams we have had our water tested several times this seems like to great of a coincidence to be anything other than either a virus yet i find no information pertaining to a virus that can cause hemmoroids or hemmoroid like symtoms,hemorrhoids are not caused by viruses or contaminated water they are caused by the pressure exerted on the blood vessels around anal ring during defecation chronic or recurrent constipation often leads to hemorrhoidal problems while it may be a coincidence that you and your wife developed them at the same time but i am guessing that you may be of similar ages and may eat the same type of foods <link>

what citrus fruits in addition to naval oranges and grapefruit should i add to my diet,it is such a joy that when cold is upon us and we have said good by to the fruits of summer we get the tangy sweet and delicious winter fruits to add to our recipes the fruits i am going to talk about today can be used in a variety of recipes from drinks to savory dishes to desserts i am a huge fan of citrus i always recommend keeping fresh lemons and limes in your refrigerator to add quick healthy and instant flavors to soups salads proteins and sweets i love the winter citrus that starts flowing in this season as well satsuma tangerines are one of my favorites they peel easy and have a great flavor i keep a bowl on my kitchen counter and we eat them faster than halloween candy goes around here it is true they are great tossed in salad naked — with nothing added — i am referring to the canned version that i am sure you have had in asian chicken salads well you can take it to a whole other healthy level by adding fresh tangerine segments and avoiding all that syrupy sugar simply peel a couple of tangerines and break the pieces into a salad now that it is winter and tomatoes are not in season and therefore not very flavorful this is a nice change up use romaine lettuce tangerine segments kalamata olives and a bit of feta cheese the salty sweet and tangy combination is fantastic another winter citrus that is one of my all time favorites is the meyer lemon the flavor is sweeter than a regular lemon and by adding the juice to your drinking water it can make getting your eight glasses a day a whole lot easier and enjoyable the zest of these lemons can be added into pancake or waffle mix salad dressings cookies chicken and fish dishes the juice of the meyer lemon can be substituted anywhere you would use a regular lemon tangelos are another great citrus that you can use in the same way you would use a mandarin like a satsuma keep these fruits around for the coming months for vitamin c for flavor and for overall health

how do you diagnose hashimoto is hypothyroidism and does this condition have effect on heart disease and osteoporosis,this is a very common problem when your foot is wet and you go into an environment where it is likely that there is some fungus everywhere on the floor it is very hard to avoid so the first and the most important thing is to try to wear either flip flops or water shoes when walking as opposed to going barefoot around the pool or the locker room shower to treat it you can use over the counter antifungals to help knock the foot fungus out if that does not work then you can see a dermatologist who can even give you a prescription medication either a cream or even a pill to help clear it some people are more prone to foot fungus than others so once you have it you might be prone to getting it again over time there is also a powder that you can put into your shoe that is very absorbent that helps prevent water from accumulating which    that water moisture and dark occluded environment is just ideal for that fungus to grow so you want to create an environment that is not so fungus friendly and also treat the underlying cause and hopefully that will help keep it at bay for a long time

my active 13 year old daughter has gained a lot of weight this year she is 5 foot 6 and weighs 198 what should we do,your daughter is obese and needs a full assessment her major weight gain occurred roughly at the time her endocrine system kicked in with her menstrual cycle i would ask her physician to look into two conditions cushing is disease and polycystic ovarian syndrome the evaluations are straightforward and both are amenable to effective therapies clearly her thyroid function needs to be assessed as well if the family history is strong for obesity it is common for girls to express the obesity gene at time of pubescence teens can sneak eat with the best of them so what you see her eat may not at all reflect what she is actually consuming if the home environment includes lots of junk food sitting around and people who are themselves not practicing healthy nutrition and exercise habits then she will emulate those habits finally research shows that in teen girls physical activity plummets by the age of 14 or so they literally stop moving but they do not stop eating thus the problem please get the medical assessment done completely and as soon as possible

how does liver damage occur in hepatitis c infection,the answer is it depends you need to discuss this with your gynecologist many factors affect whether or not a tubal ligation reversal may be successful some of these factors are your age your general health status the type of tubal ligation procedure you had whether or not you previously had a successful pregnancy whether or not you have had any other gynecological surgeries such as for endometriosis or fibroid tumors these are not the only considerations obviously if you are past the age of menopause reversing your tubal ligation will not enable you to get pregnant because you are no longer producing eggs because it is been so long since you had your tubes tied the records about the type of procedure performed may no longer be available however if the doctor who performed the procedure is still practicing you might consult him or her to discover if the records are available taking this information to your current gynecologist will be helpful in determining if tubal ligation reversal might be successful for you wishing you all the best

my son was seizure free for 20 years but is now experiencing seizures again why might this be happening,the short answer is start the medications immediately most people do not receive prescription medications to treat the flu because it is a virus the usual recommendation is to rest drink plenty of fluids and take over the counter medications to ease symptoms such as headache vomiting etc  but it is different when you have hiv or aids when a person with hiv or aids gets a case of the flu it is a very serious matter the treatment plan usually includes a round of antiviral drugs given for 7 days but here is the kicker for maximum effectiveness these drugs should be started with 48 hours of the onset of symptoms so please begin this course of medications as soon as possible that is not to say you should delay if you are starting the meds outside that 48 hour window you should still begin the medications as early as possible and take the full course of antiviral drugs exactly as prescribed please monitor your symptoms closely if you develop a fever assuming you do not already have one or if you begin to feel congested in your lungs feeling waterlogged coughing up sputum from the lungs difficulty breathing call your doctor immediately influenza can move quickly into pneumonia in people with a compromised immune system best wishes to you

i almost passed out last night 3 separate times each while doing something completely different can you help me  1st time it happened i was doing my routine workout 2nd time i was standing up from the dinner table 3rd time i was taking a shower and ended up falling down  i have never had this happen before its a little scary,this is a disease resulting from the abnormal reaction by the body is immune system to gluten a protein found in many grains such as wheat rye and barley and other foods in people who have celiac disease the immune system causes damage to the small intestine and prevents the proper absorption of nutrients from food symptoms include diarrhea anemia and weight loss
i was diagnosed with chlamydia and am now being tested for all other stis such as hiv is this routine  i was called last night by my doctor telling me that i tested + for chlamydia i was given 1g of zithromax & took it last night i called this morning to ask when to retest & they told me that i would need to retest for other stds such as hiv what are the chances that i have contracted another more serious sti such as hiv  i looked up symptoms for hiv & i am not showing any symptoms in all honesty i am relatively healthy & have not been showing symptoms for anything   including chlamydia,what we know now is some great studies have been done within the last two years about the relationship between sleep and weight loss and weight gain there are two hormones in particular that have specific amount to do with appetite another thing we know about sleep deprivation is that your metabolism slows down well if you have a slow metabolism you are not burning fuel efficiently so it is going into fat storage and fat deposits and again causing more weight gain we also know with sleep deprivation we have increased levels of cortisol well that can be another problem which causes more appetite here is the most fascinating part about the research i think all those other things aside when you are sleep deprived if i was to lay out a healthy snack for you or a very non healthy sugary snack for you you would gun for the sugary food you would go for the less healthy food so your food choice is even affected by sleep deprivation how they are not 100 sure how but that craving that you are having seems to be more towards a comfort food which tends to be high carbohydrate high sugar high fat

are there any new creams to help eliminate the lines between my eyes,i have to talk to a lot of patients about weight loss one of the things that i will ask them is did the doctor go over what their bmi or body mass index is that gives us an idea of really how obese they might be and then incorporate lifestyle changes first so many times we think of a pill as an instant quick fix and that is really not the answer i will ask patients how active they are and are they incorporating some type of exercise into their daily routine simple things like walking can really help reduce weight and make you feel better you should be walking at least 10 000 steps a day and to help you track that you can actually buy a pedometer in almost any store today they are pretty inexpensive they are under about 20 and you can actually track your progress through a diary and feel good also making changes to your diet that can include decreasing the amount of fatty foods that you have making more healthier options try these options first before you go down the path to medication there is one over the counter medication approved by the fda to help people lose weight and it is called alli or orlistat orlistat helps people lose weight by blocking some of the fat they eat from being absorbed even though orlistat is available over the counter it is a good idea to talk to your doctor before you take it
if i do not exercise and eat a lot of protein from yogurt and protein shakes would that make me gain weight  i am 511 and 185 lbs,who says that listerine is good for your gums i personally never understood this fascination that people have with rinsing the only thing that controls gingivitis prevents periodontitis and bad breath is the actual act of brushing and flossing one is teeth everything else is just fluff there are mouthwashes that can help control the deleterious bacteria in our mouth mainly chlorhexidine peridex however they are by prescription and stain our teeth they are used by many peridontists and other dentists to control bacteria after dental surgery but we recommend their use only for a limited time in addition if you ask dental pathologists the specialists in the diseases of the mouth many will tell you that many mouthwashes are laden with alcohol which actually damages our gums it is compounded by the fact that people rinse their mouth with an alcohol based mouthwash and then go and smoke a cigarette they kill that top protective layer of cells with the alcohol and introduce the carcinogens from the cigarettes right into the sub layer of the gums causing more damage review your brushing technique and timing speak to your hygienistdentistperiodontist about proper brushing technique and use the mouth rinse when you need fresh breath for a few minutes this is how long the effects of mouthwash last as to the ada approval any reputable company can pay the fee required to get the ada seal it is a great marketing device but the real agency of approval is the fda food and drug administration if a product is approved to be sold by a pharmacy it is likely to have fda approval that should be ok my recommendation do not waste your hard earned money on mouthwashes spend your money on professional cleanings and go to a dentisthygienist who cares enough to give you feedback on your home care and educate you in proper hygiene you will get much more bang for your buck

do i need to stay on cholesterol drugs forever,abnormal cholesterol levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease heart attacks and strokes although many people with high cholesterol will never develop cardiovascular disease it is impossible to accurately predict who will and who will not the first treatment for anyone with abnormal and potentially unhealthy cholesterol levels dyslipidemia is to make healthy lifestyle changes this means exercise most days of the week eat a heart healthy diet and do not smoke for people at average risk these actions together are effective at preventing heart attack and stroke however most people with dyslipidemia find it difficult to improve their cholesterol numbers into the normal range with lifestyle changes alone and ldl or “bad” cholesterol levels tend to rise with age the question of whether to treat dyslipidemia with a cholesterol medication like a statin is complex and depends on your expected risk for heart disease as well as your own preferences if you have already had a heart attack or stroke lowering high cholesterol is extremely important to help prevent another one only you and your doctor can decide if long term treatment for dyslipidemia is the best option for you

i am dieting to lose weight should i worry about falling short on key nutrients,when you reduce your calories to lose weight you run the risk of falling short on key nutrients that is why choosing nutrient rich foods is particularly important when you are dieting fortunately some of the foods richest in nutrition    fruits vegetables and whole grains    also happen to be low in fat and calories they also tend to be higher in fiber so they help fill you up even when you are eating less to lose weight even on the healthiest diet however you may fall short on nutrients over time the nutrients that are most often in short supply are iron and calcium but if you are dieting to lose weight over an extended time you may run a risk of falling short on other nutrients taking a multivitamin can help ensure that you meet your basic needs while you try to lose weight but remember a pill is no substitute for a healthy nutrient rich diet “dieting” typically entails food restriction in both the amount of food as well as the type of food that you consume both of which could potentially lead to malnourishment if done incorrectly the good thing is that the types of food that you should be restricting on a healthy diet typically do not offer you much nutritional value anyways which is why you would want to restrict them in the first place you should not have to worry about nutritional deficiencies when dieting so long as you are eating a balanced diet with a variety of different foods and as long as you are not following a very low calorie diet be wary however of some diet plans that severely restrict certain foods or food groups altogether some of these diets may have varying degrees of merit but it is best to consult with a dietitian or doctor before undergoing major dietary changes to help distinguish between helpful and harmful dietary practices

what is best flexeril or robaxin have herniated discs spinal stenosis and arthritis in low back and neck help,i had preeclampsia with my son all it took was a urine test for them to identify you swell up all over too with it and my face was very swolen when they induced my labor they check the amount of protein in your urine and if you have too much of it they run about two more urine tests where you pee in a bucket thing for 24 hours cause if it goes up so high you have to be induced for the danger it does you and the baby mine was not allowing sky to gain weight and he was already practicing breathing for labor at 34 weeks they induced me at 35 weeks and he was 4 lbs 2 oz when we left when i had preeclampsia i felt hot all over and dizzy especially when i showered or stood for very long the point is though is that i was having the symptoms of preeclampsia for months before it came on full force symptoms like yours the best thing that you can do is rest and rest a lot stress brings it on that is how mine came on so you just need to not worry about it because they check your urine and every time you have an appointment that is one of the things they check for as long as you do not have a high enough protein count in your urine you should be okay when i had sky mine was so bad i could not see him until the next morning at i had him at 413 p m all you can do is take it easy they will let you know if you get into the danger zone that is one thing they check for every time you pee in the little cups they give you i really hope this settles your fears stress brings it on so try and relax for now

what has been causing my abdominal pain for 10 weeks straight now gallbladder is out ibs is the latest diagnosis i have constant clear diarrhea that is making it very difficult to go to work i regularly have taken tylenol and tramadol over several years for back and nerve pain i have cut down significantly on them but no change the other day i took remeron and it burned really bad in my stomach for the first time ever i also have blood in my stool about half the time ct scan with contrast blood test and colonoscopy 2 5 months ago came back negative any ideas,the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors 1 type of fracture   compound fractures   take much longer to heal 2 displaced bone fragments   if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase 3 infection   increases the healing time 4 disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site   also hampers healing 5 malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time 6 early mobilization of the joint   before complete healing in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis i am sorry about that but platelet rich plasma prp does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing bone formation in your case and hence your recovery as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress hence if the fractured bone site heals completely which will eventually happen in due time   there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot i hope this helps
is it serious when a child gets a rash with a cold  my son got it first but only got the rash at bedtime we treated it with hydrocortizone cream my daughter has  nothe same cold but got the rash last night and it only goes away when we give her benidryl sp should i go to the hospital or keep treating her at homer she moves around like nothing is wrong when she has tylenol and benadryl,metoprolol can slightly raise triglycerides and decrease the hdl cholesterol if you are worried about this or have questions about whether the metoprolol may be raising your cholesterol you should talk to your health care professional most often the benefits of taking the metoprolol outweigh the risks of the changes in cholesterol but you should consult your doctor before making any decisions about your prescriptions

can the drug nortriptyline cause your penis to decrease in size  the reason for asking is since i have been on this medication i have noticed a decrease in size of an inch from the size of an erect penis this is the only medication i am on can someone help me,the penis does not really shrink from the point of maximum penis growth age 17 believe it or not so if you are accurate in your measurement it is not due to the nortriptyline some antidepressants can cause problems with libido or even make it more difficult to have an orgasm but it should not change the size of your penis erections are all about blood the engorgement of blood in your penis as you may have experienced some erections are more rigid than others more blood shunted to the penis under the right circumstances with the right attitude i suspect that that lost inch will mysteriously reappear do not fret if you are worried about size you can always use one of those penis pumps i have a friend who swears by these things apparently the only issue with a pump is skin irritation so just make sure you use a penis skin moisturizer and you will be all good man1 man oil is a solid one hope this helps and good luck

how is epilepsy diagnosed,the two most common causes of perineal or genital numbness is compression of the nerves in your spine called as cauda equina or compression of the nerves in the perineum itself only sensory loss is uncommon but still possible in cauda equina syndrome ces since it is more commonly associated with other symptoms compression of nerve in the perineum typically occurs in cyclists i will suggest you to go to the closest er emergency room urgently you need to be evaluated to reach the correct diagnosis they may also order an mri for you to identify the exact site of nerve compression since the treatment varies as per the site of compression delay in treatment may make the symptoms irreversible for further information consult a neurologist online   > <link>

what can be done to prevent hpv transmission to my partner what are the risks if he is infected  hello  i found out i have hpv from an abnormal pap smear however i do not have genital warts or any external symptoms i am currently in a monogamous relationship with a man i was wondering what type of precautions should be taken to prevent spreading the disease to him and what are the risks if the disease is transmitted to him i know it slightly increases the risks of some cancers in men but is there anything else to be concerned about  thank you,first i am sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus hpv but i am glad to hear you are getting regular pap smears unfortunately your partner may already be infected even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse and use of a condom is not necessarily protective either since a condom does not cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years though this is less likely if you are passing it back and forth  both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts if you have additional questions about this do not hesitate to ask your gynecologist hpv is incredibly common it is estimated that up to 50 of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives take care i recently went to my gynecologist and well i was told that i had abnormal cells on the cervix and that hpv caused it my doctor said that everybody has hpv if you had sex at least once that is why you need to have that pap smear done every year to detect cancer cells which are caused by this hpv virus in between other things so needless to say that you cannot avoid transmitting it to him since he already has it unless he has never had sex do not quote me i read about it and it enforces what my doctor said according to the info i got however educated and uneducated people will have different discussions about this the best thing is to go see your own personal doctor and ask them these questions good luck <positive_smiley>
is there estrogen in vitamin e,no there is no estrogen in vitamin e vitamin e is not estrogen rich
can zantac cause a false positive drug test,it is can be tough diagnosing an itchy body hives are red itchy welts on the skin and may be caused by various allergic agents and even nervous conditions treatment of hives is directed at removing the source of the offending source i had a generalized body itch took the same course of action as you and eventually broke down and was seen in a walk in medical clinic for professional help my symptoms were mostly limited to feeling itchy from head to toe with only a faint trace of a skin rash i though that i had considered all possible causes including bug bites and new products entering my body such as foods beverages soaps and medications i also noted that my wife who shared our common bed was free of the same symptoms obviously i was not contagious in my situation the hives condition was caused by an oral ant biotic that i had already taken for 5 days since i had previously taken this same anti  biotic in the past without negative consequences and did not immediately see a reaction to the current treatment regime i mistakenly excluded the anti biotic as my allergic source in my case i was given an injectable dose of corticosteroid prescribed prednisone and directed to terminate the offending ant biotic in your case after 3 4 days without resolving the issue through hydro cortisone and antihistamines it is probably time to see a doctor

sinus issues mucous build up in nose and post nasal drip do i need surgery,i am sorry to hear you are having a hard time what is happening to you is called early satiety  meaning you are getting full early in the eating process when this happens it is best to see your doctor and describe your symptoms so he or she can run some tests it could be gastro intestinal gi related such as irritable bowel or gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd or something else entirely you need to find out what is going on as you are likely not getting adequate nutrition and no doubt your quality life is suffering good luck
can estrogen cause erythema nodosum,why [not] flumist it is an equally effective some studies say more effective flu vaccine that can be sprayed in the nose no needles when i do have to negotiate with a reluctant child about a shot i do a few things 1 i give them choices they can have one shot assuming they only need one or two 2 i can give them a booster instead of a shot it is the same thing but the word booster sounds less painful  3 they can get it in their arm or leg where it does not hurt very much or their eye of course we do not do eye shots so this becomes an easy choice 4 i tell them this i am not supposed to do this but if you do not tell anyone i will use the little tiny baby needle the one we use for infants instead of the big person needle how about that  5 and finally if this little booster hurts you tell the nurse right away and she will take it out immediately  of course she is going to do that anyway  the games we play convince a reluctant child to get a flu shot who is the adult and who is the child there is no convincing a child i have seen bribery done if it was my situation the child would have learned right from the beginning that sometimes we must do things that are not the most pleasant but will be over soon never lie to a child and say it will not hurt there was one thing i taught and allowed my children to do for a shot either alone or accompanied by me to sing as loud as possible happy birthday it always worked and they always wanted me to sing along loud of course the dr was warned first
is there anything that can interfere with the effectiveness of the mirena iud,fortunately there is really nothing specific you have to avoid the mirena has two modes of contraceptive protection the first is the mechanical presence of the iud inside the uterine cavity this has been the mechanism of action of all the earlier iuds which were just inert plastic mirena also has the the slow infusion of synthetic progesterone into the area of the uterine lining this makes the lining very thinned out hence lighter or absent menstrual periods most importantly would be to check your strings at the end of each period or calendar month and to stay within a monogamous sexual relationship if you do have multiple partners then use of a condom would be suggested to avoid infections like gonorrhea or chlamydia

i am a 45 year old man and have little facial hair basically i have no sideburns what can i do to promote hair growth  i do have some facial hair chin cheeks neck but there are other bare patches as well this did not bother me when i was younger but as i age i would like the option of growing a beard to mask skin blemishes wrinkles etc what are my options what can i start to do on my own and if that does not work when should i consult my doctor,there is probably little or nothing that can be done medically to make you grow facial hair if those hair follicles were not present when you were born you can not grow new ones it is too late to change your parents and genetics so the amount of facial hair that you have now is about all you will get i do not think that medicines used for patchy baldness in men will work the same way on your face but that would be up to your doctor or a dermatologist to determine testosterone a male hormone can cause some facial hair growth in men how are low but again if you do not have those follicles it may not help your first step is to see a dermatologist
i had a baby a few months ago and i am not comfortable using sunscreen on my baby are sunscreen safe on young babies,not necessarily sometimes especially in women who have normally light periods your period can just not come for a month it is pretty common for periods to be irregular sometimes there were a few times in which i did not get mine for at least 3 months my doctor said it was normal and i got birth control to regulate my periods

i understand that i can get less expensive health insurance coverage than i now have but does not that also mean the benefits will not be as good,not necessarily in fact if you have been buying your own insurance meaning you do not get it at work there is at least a reasonable chance the coverage provided through plans that comply with the law will be better than what you had it does not always work out that way but it is certainly a possibility you just need to shop and compare
i am concerned about medical bankruptcy it looks as though i could get the bronze plan for free with a subsidy  i currently use a colorado state medical plan that is not insurance if i were to have a major medical event and be taken to a private hospital i would not be covered and could lose my house under the bronze plan i pay 40 does this mean if i have a 100 000 hospital bill i have to pay 40 000 is there a way to get the subsidy to pay for my insurance premium through my retirement plan which has better coverage than the bronze plan,all plans sold throught the marketplaces cap your total annual out of pocket spending at 6 350 per year once you hit that total dollar amount your insurer must pick up the remainder of your medical expenses if you qualify for a subsidy the amount you receive will be tied to the second lowest cost silver plan however you can apply it toward any of the plans if you buy a gold or platinum level insurance policy you will still receive your subsidy you will just be required to pay the difference in cost
how to get fluid behind the eardrum to drain i have been to the doctors several times and on several antibiotics and i have no pain in my ear but i cant hear from the fluid built up what can i do,there are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion fluid 1 you can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ent 2 decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc have all been used with limited success sometimes it helps sometimes it does not antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of plumbing and ventilation issue not an infection 3 an ent may need to surgical drain the fluid tympanostomy or suction and place tubes in your ears i went scuba diving for 6 days in a row last week and got water behind my right eardrum i kept hoping it would clear up but after 8 days it was as bad as ever and it would only clear momentary if i hung my head upside down with my head right side up the water rested against my eardrum and i could not hear much through that ear after reading on the web about the structure of the ear i learned that the eustachian tube connects the ear to the nose and i realized that the water was going to have to exit that tube now apparently that tube is not there to drain liquid or it would have done so already i bet it is just for air to flow through to equalize pressure probably thanks to our aquatic ape ancestors whatever it is the key and the only way to get flow though it is to take advantage of it is connection to the nose i pinched my nose and blew hard until my ears popped that is the same thing scuba divers do as they descend by the way apparently i did not do it often enough because some of that ocean water wound up on the wrong side of my eardrum and the only way it would get there is if the pressure on the inside of my eardrum was lower than the pressure on the outside where the ocean was then i pinched my nose and sucked hard until my ears popped going the other direction i was moving air in and out of my ears through the eustachian tube after doing this about 10 times the water was gone and i can once again hear through my right ear fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear i caution you though about the decision to have tubes put in the ear drum to drain this fluid i had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out i actually had the little tiny plastic rings they are less tubes than just little rings of plastic most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not i now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem i cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria
could i or the person i am with be infertile  i been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years i am a college age student and along time ago we discovered i was allergic to latex anyways i did not have any form of birth control for like the first two years we were having sex now i been on birth control for almost two years now yes i got tested all the time but never got pregnant i have regular periods and i been with the same guy all along i want kids in the future not right now so what is the chances of being infertile,it is certainly possible having unprotected sex for years without getting pregnant you are either very lucky or something is amiss it would not be likely that a medical provider would do a fertility work up on either one of you now especially since you are on oral contraceptives now but the possibility does exists that there may be a fertility problem i advice you to see what book market it well <link>

how do you decide what is a healthy size and weight,as a physician and expert in fitness and nutrition i am all about optimizing health and well being this issue of size tugs at my doctor is protective instincts e g preventing disease and disability while as a woman i feel deeply for any woman who has ever sobbed while staring at her closet trying to find something decent to wear this issue of what constitutes a healthy size and weight is a hot topic of debate among scientists and experts in the field dr steven blair has championed the notion that it is all about fitness not size while others argue the smaller the better to ensure optimal health and longevity since no one has a solution let me boldly go forward with a few suggestions 1 your size issue must involve health and wellness looking at physical appearance alone without considering overall health and fitness is leaving off half of your best body equation if you are really interested in living life to the fullest that requires you do the work to stay fit and nourish yourself healthfully you want to clothe a healthy happy woman – not just a size 2 know thyself just like you know your size you need to know your other body numbers take a tape measure to your waist if it is greater than 35 you are packing on inner abdominal pounds placing you at higher risk of developing heart disease and diabetes if your body fat is greater than 35 you are at higher risk for breast cancer and potentially ovarian cancer too much weight can also have an accumulative effect on your weight bearing joints eventually leading to arthritis and disability many of my patients are very fit a size 10 14 normal waist size and a good body fat percentage keep in mind the goal is not to be skinny it is to be healthy physically independent and out of the red zone for disease and disability 3 all women need to pay attention to their self care to stay out of the red zone you have got to take care of yourself your mind and body benefit from daily physical activity ideally accruing about 400 cals throughout the day and injecting intervals of intensity as well as healthy nutrition high quality whole foods being mindful of portions and total calories consumed and eating a balanced mealsnack every 3 4 hour through dinner science backs me up on this recommendation which is true for men and women alike 4 women need attractive enjoyable clothing options to live and exercise in when a woman is beginning her journey toward improving her lifestyle habits she wants to feel good about herself better larger size 16 and over clothing options help her accomplish that goal many of my patients often call these clothes “transitional ” as a woman gets more active and pares away more excess body fat she will transition to other clothing which may end up being size 12 14

why are there so many diseases with sepsis  septic  septicemia  or blood poisoning in their name,unfortunately both medical personnel and laypeople have used these terms interchangeably and then linked them to either a particular organism usually bacterial that can cause sepsis or to a site in the body in which an infection originates that leads to sepsis for example meningococcal sepsis meningococcal septicemia septic meningitis and meningococcal blood poisoning can refer to the same entity an infection of the patient by the bacteria neisseria meningitidis that has spread from the meninges brain membranes to the bloodstream resulting in the patient having at least two of the four criteria for sepsis common examples of a body site used in the same way are puerperal sepsis puerperal septicemia puerperal or childbirth blood poisoning and maternal septicemia postpartum all four terms represent infection of the female reproductive system that leads to sepsis criteria for the patient the infectious agent is not described when the body site is linked to sepsis or the other terms the following is a short partial list of both organism and organ system and organ related terms that are seen in both the lay and medical literature mrsa sepsis sepsis caused by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteria vre sepsis sepsis caused by vancomycin resistant enterococcus species of bacteria urosepsis sepsis originating from a urinary tract infection wound sepsis sepsis originating from an infection of a wound neonatal sepsis or septicemia sepsis seen in newborns usually in the first four weeks after birth septic abortion an abortion due to infection with sepsis in the mother there are many more examples of linking terms to sepsis for example aids tattoo spider bite occasionally terms like hemorrhagic septicemia are used to describe a symptom internal bleeding that occurs with sepsis the trend in medicine currently is to decrease the use of the terms septicemia and blood poisoning in favor of the terms sepsis or septic because sepsis is defined most concisely

my lips seemed to be thinning as i get older i do not want injections are there other options for me,it is true that for everybody your lips do flatten and become thinner over time some people never have big lips and so they will notice it more and maybe at an earlier age injections are one of the main ways to add volume back but for people who do not want volume that way there are some lip liners that you can use and some lip plumpers that help a little bit most of these work by causing some irritation that increases blood supply that gives a temporary effect of fullness for some people that works fine and otherwise it can be irritating so there is not that much that you can do but you might be able to just work with a good lip gloss or a lip liner to add the appearance of volume the other thing to think about is your teeth because your teeth is what supports your lip if your teeth are in or pointing in or if you lose volume in terms of bone around the mouth that can also cause your lip to flatten and look thinner over time so just getting something as simple as veneers can help invert your lip and give you great support of your lips and make a very big difference without doing any injections at all

i am 49 years old and have dry skin and pimples in the jaw line can you suggest an effective acne remedy,you may be suffering from hormonal acne up to 50 of all women experience some form of adult hormonal acne the week before their period some women are even more prone to adult acne because they have larger problems with androgens these are women with polycystic ovarian syndrome because the overabundance of androgens throws their monthly cycles completely off kilter they never know when they will experience an acne breakout most women who suffer from adult hormonal acne experience their worst breakouts on their chin and around their lips adult hormonal acne typically begins after age 25 and occurs on and off during the course of adulthood the bad news is that when a woman begins to go through menopause her female hormones begin to dwindle and those androgens become even more dominant here comes the acne yet again try washing your face twice a day with a gentle soap there is no need to wash your face more often unless you are sweating profusely or have a very dirty job salicylic acid found in a number of acne products works to dissolve the sebaceous oils helping to remove any skin debris that is clogging your pores but be sure to rinse it off thoroughly also find a very mild benzoyl peroxide cream something that is 2 5 or less when applied directly to the skin at night it can help unclog you pores as you sleep try this every other night at first
person a has some sperm on his hands hands get in mouth then asks to eat me out could i get pregnanat  do you think its possible to get pregnant if for example my boyfriend ejaculates in his sock or something some of the semen seeps through and gets on his hands and right after he goes to the kitchen to eat something he eats that something with his hands he licks his fingers etc therefore the semen is now in his mouth and then i arrive at his house and he asks to give me oral  should i just avoid oral just in case or is that really irrational of me,the odds of your getting pregnant under the circumstances you describe is slim to none sperm do not survive well outside their natural environment in the male reproductive organs sperm have a hard enough time surviving inside the vagina which is hostile to sperm let alone taking on saliva and the mechanical crushing of mastication especially if you are describing semen transfer from the hands to the mouth while ingesting food or a beverage the odds any sperm would survive to subsequently impregnate you during oral sex is infinitesimal of course you should always practice safe sex when you are truly having sex and if you do not want to become pregnant then you have a responsibility to use some sort of birth control yourself a condom helps protect against sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy and you increase your chances of staying pregnancy free by using a second birth control method such as the pill or an iud hope this helps

having lightmild chest pains near left brestarmpit heart problems at 20  hi i am a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very light chest pain near my armpitbreast area my bmi is 38 currently working on lowering i exercise at least 4 times a week about an 1 hour of 4 5 miles note that i have been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11 i have been working on eating correctly as well i have recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 cups of water my blood pressure is 13481 usually my resting rate ranges from 74 96 bpm,i suggest you tablet folvite 5 mg of folic acid one tablet per day the recommended dose of folic acid is a controversial topic various doctors favor 1 mg to 5 mg per day the best part is that the folic acid has no side effects it is a water soluble vitamin and an excess of it gets excreted in urine so we recommend 5 mg per day to all our patients when sufficient dose is harmless there is no need to take a chance by giving low doses one more concern of mine is that you have to check with your neurologist if it is safe to go ahead with pregnancy while on lamictal lamotrigine the safety of lamictal is not established by studies but if your physician has good experience with personal case series then i think you can continue for further information consult a neurologist online   > <link>

what reason is my glans and penis have erythema and blisters after having sex with my wife  when i used condom there is no problem i feel a bit itchy and uncomfortable,there really is no sure way of knowing without inspecting the blisters however because of the reddening of the skin it leads me to believe you have an allergy keep in mind an allergy can appear at any time you could eat peanuts all your life then one day have a reaction she could also have a yeast infection which has been passed on to you it is rare for a male to get blisters from a transferred yeast infection but it can happen yeast infections can be transferred during intercourse but it is not a true sexually transmitted disease women can get yeast infections from antibiotics or wearing panties that do not breathe and lastly the reason i want you to go to the dr for inspection of the blisters herpes do not fly off the handle i think this is the least likely also keep in mind that herpes is not just transferred by intercourse if she has a cold sore or fever blister on her mouth she could have transmitted it to you via oral sex please do not automatically think your wife is cheating get an accurate diagnosis from your doctor before you even give it a first thought

how well do injectible fillers work on men,we have had a good run with filling injections such as juvederm restylane perline artefill radiesse and recently sculptra which actually rather than offering immediate filling encourages the tissues under the skin surface to thicken and tighten new collagen is formed we have a large pool of experience with female patients the ladies are happy with the results of course people would like to have longer lasting products with less risk and science continues to stay up all night in the laboratory working on that botox and dysport have proven their value not only in the area of the horizontal forehead lines but the frown lines between the eyebrows and crow is feet around the eyes also a very hyperactive chin muscle that seems to quiver with every facial movement can be controlled with these medications which essentially lightly paralyze the nerves how are men doing with it well certainly there are fewer men who seek the services than women one of the things we have learned is that particularly with botox and dysport it takes a larger dose to paralyze the muscle because men is muscles are thicker another issue that must be dealt with is that bruising must be avoided since men do not have the option of applying makeup as women do however when the techniques are done well there is very little chance of bruising we always favor immediate application of ice as well as encourage patients to stop taking any medication such as aspirin so that there will be less chance of bruising we are also currently investigating using arnica as a preventative just as we use it in face and neck lifting blepharoplasty and brow surgery

why does my penis itch  all right about a month ago my penis started to itch i figured it was just an allergic reaction or dry skin or something but after a month i figured something was definitely going on i started researching on the internet and all fingers point to chlamydia or gonorrhea i called a clinic and they cant get me in until monday and its thursday well i sprayed peroxide into my urethra and all of the symptoms cleared up hopefully the peroxide got rid of everything without doing any damage,peroxide will not cure anything definitely not chlamydia or gonorrhea so keep that appointment on monday if you think your sexual history and symptoms justify it there is an easy urine test that can give you the correct answer expect a lecture about using condoms the penis is covered by skin and there are about a hundred reasons for itching from allergy to your laundry detergentdryer softeners or soap to eczema or a fungal infection you cannot accurately diagnose yourself over the internet so get a medical professional invovled about two weeks ago my penis started to itch i thought it was the new underwear but i was wrong i have not had sex prior to it happening i wake up from sleeping and my penis itches i i pee and it itches i have cleaned it everytime but it still itches any answers would b appreciated jim your penis may be itching simply because you have dry skin down there it is a common problem and nothing to freak out about buy yourself some penis health creme one containing vitamin a e and some shea butter is nice too and use it every day your itch should be gone in a few days get tested regularly for sti is regardless though it is the smart and responsible thing to do cheers that would not clear up an sti so it is a good idea to get it checked for common penile itching unrelated to stis using a superior penis health cream health professionals recommend man1 man oil with natural moisturizers can help to deal with the itchiness good luck penis cancer

person a has some sperm on his hands hands get in mouth then asks to eat me out could i get pregnanat  do you think its possible to get pregnant if for example my boyfriend ejaculates in his sock or something some of the semen seeps through and gets on his hands and right after he goes to the kitchen to eat something he eats that something with his hands he licks his fingers etc therefore the semen is now in his mouth and then i arrive at his house and he asks to give me oral  should i just avoid oral just in case or is that really irrational of me,i advise you to get her ultrasound done first to confirm her pregnancy there are also chances that she may not be pregnant and this may be due to simple hormonal changes that occur in a womans body at this age only pregnancy test may sometimes give you false positive tests

can sleep help me look younger,well first of all everybody knows what somebody looks like who has not had a good night is sleep so just aesthetically we see that there is a big difference in somebody who has had a good night is sleep and somebody who has not but what does that really mean one of the things we know is that with sleep deprivation circulation is down you do not circulate nearly as well as you would have if you were well rested and so one of the things we see with poor circulation we see edema underneath the eye the same thing holds through for dark circles the skin underneath your eye turns out to be almost paper thin it is incredibly small and so the capillaries that are under here when the blood is not circulating well and giving that nice rosy appearance can pull which again can cause these dark circles now you may get a ton of sleep and still have dark circles because that could be genetically predisposed next we look at overall skin health okay and so when we look at your skin what we now say is a healthy skin it is sort of a glow rosy cheeks red cheeks things of that nature not necessarily the red nose per se but just the appearance again that is a circulation issue and we know that circulation is decreased significantly with sleep deprivation

vaginal burning with no discharge or smell,i want to discuss strategies for trying to enjoy sex and intimacy more despite fm  many tell me the effect of fm on sex is the biggest problem in a relationship call me old fashioned but if your partner is willing to be open minded and adapt to the fm you  i think love gets stronger and conquers all  open communication this is the most important often couples are not comfortable at first having converstions about sex some find it embarrassing to speak freely perhaps a good starting point is connecting on the fm discuss fm and how it specifically interferes with your intimacy reaffirm that avoiding sex does not equal rejecting the partner progress the communication gradually and become more open in sharing each other is most intimate concerns and needs specific solutions identify specfic barriers to your unique situation and solve them if you can if your main barrier is lack of libidointerest then determine if it is from fear of pain fatigue depression medicine side effects disinterest in your partner etc do not just assume it is the fibro and nothing can be done your specific barrier list can be treated step by step by adjustingchanging meds modifying routines etc to remove libido lowering factors work with your health professionals of course many times the process of simply recognizing the barriers and planning to address them results in a positive effect placebo and improves sexual mood if pain during intercourse is a problem try to id the specific cause  is it painful muscle spasms during sex if so consider a pre sex routine to relax muscles sometimes your doctor can prescribe certain meds to relax muscles and decrease tension to take an hour before sexual activity i e a pre emptive strike strategy painful pressure find positions with minimal pressure if the problem is not pain but poor sexual organ responsiveness try lubricants stimulating creamsproducts natural products or talk with your doctor about prescribed sexual stimulant meds i know these sound pretty basic and obvious but many times couples do not try the obvious due to uncertainty if it is ok to do something different it is ok to do this re discover the romance intimacy is not the same as having sex and it does not only happen in the bedroom intimacy occurs throughout the day couples can work on sending intimacy signals during the day smiles compliments appreciative remarks soft hugs etc try not to let fm stop these signals couples can also take more time to get ready yes i am talking about foreplay strive for natural and comfortable including a comfortable environment free from drafts teach each other to rediscover touch with gentle stroking massage soft hugs kissing holding no poking squeezing or playful slaps discover new rituals warm oil massage couple is hot tub hot bath or shower sexual activities other than intercourse can be explored and enjoyed find comfortable positions we can figure this out experiment with

does the sore always come back in the same place or can it occur inside the vagina too  i have had genital herpes for years and my outbreaks are rare and mild i take valcylovir sp i have itching and burning inside the vagina and some bumps inside i am wondering if this is an outbreak or vaginitis,i am sorry you are having symptoms like mood swings and hot flashes that sounds unpleasant i want to let you know that these symptoms can be caused by things other than a lack of estrogen usually one ovary can provide enough female hormones to keep a woman from getting the symptoms you describe so i would recommend you get checked out by a health care provider to see if your estrogen levels really are causing these symptoms or if it is something else in answer to your question there is no such thing as an over the counter estrogen pill  estrogen is a regulated substance that can only be obtained by prescription there are many over the counter products that claim to improve menopause symptoms these products usually are herbal supplements many women say these products do help them with the symptoms of menopause while these products generally are safe to take keep in mind they are not regulated in the same way drugs are use your best judgement when taking any over the counter product even if it is labeled as natural  all natural  or herbal  i hope this helps

what is diabetes,fever is generally harmless as a matter of fact fever helps fight infection so it is more therapeutic than dangerous fevers under 105 in older children is not uncommon any fever in babies under 6 months are taken more seriously but as the child ages seasoned medical providers do not get excited certainly not as excited about fever as parents i have been treating children for over four decades and i have not encountered a fever alone that would prompt an er visit but of course that is me it is not the fever that is the issue but rather the cause of the fever and those other symptoms that accompany the fever for instance a fever with a severe sore throat could be strep or a fever with a dozen other cold symptoms could just mean a viral infection a fever with lethargy stiff neck and a very ill appearing child could be meningitis roseola a common childhood illness can mount a fever in the 105 range for three days in a row before the characteristic rash appears during the fever stage this high temp certainly gets attention fever is probably one of the most misunderstood and improperly treated symptoms it is not a disease that people encounter so the more your read about it the better you will be informed and the more comfortable you will be when you see it again and again and again comfort comes with practice but until you can keep you cool when kids are hot you will need to engage the expertise of your friendly medical provider

will a penial implant help my situation  i have been diagnosed with ed for the past 5 years i have tried pills which worked for a short time but nothing to write home about  i was wondering if i should consider penial implants would help me and my wife happy as a more permenant solution i have some medical issues that have attributed to my ed i have type 2 diabetes high blood pressure high cholesterol depression and ckd all of which i am being treated for  what should i know before going foward with htis,yes it can help your situation having penile implant surgery is a major life changing decision my friend is husband had the surgery performed twice the first surgical procedure resulted in lots of pain and a deformed looking penis the 2nd surgery done 4 years ago had more positive results there are multiple types of implants to meet your needs here are the disadvantages and advantages as i know them to be   non inflatable type   a rod is implanted and is simply bent up to reveal the erect penis it is easy to use for individuals with dexterity or arthritic conditions the downside is that the man will have a constant erection the penis is always erect and just needs to be bent upwards to reveal the erection this can be annoying and sometimes painful this appliance can also cause a thinning of the penile flesh and can be perceived as having an abnormal appearance   2 piece inflatable appliance  it is promoted as being easy to use because the man simply pumps it up to have an erect penis and pumps it down when not in use fluid is transferred into cylinders which become firm and imitate an erect penis with this devise the penis is not as firm as with other appliances may be difficult to inflate and can cause penile tissue thinning   3 piece inflatable units   the appliance is pumped up for an erection and a release valve is pressed to eliminate the erect state again cylinders are filled with fluid to develop an erection this device is promoted as providing the most natural look and feel has more fluid being sent through the cylinders to produce a firmer erection cause the least amount of pain and discomfort and is least likely to cause penis tissue deterioration with all of these devices the individual will never again be able to have a natural occurring erection my recommendation is to search out the most competent urologic surgeons and review the number of procedures performed and their patient satisfaction rate this process is best accomplished through internet searches some urologists hold regular classes for men interested in having the surgery completed at these sessions all questions may be addressed and an opportunity to see how the devices work is usually provided choose a surgeon that treats the individual post surgically with recovery in a hospital setting for a few days some surgeries are performed as a same day procedure with possible resulting complications bleeding pain urinary difficulty being ignored additionally with the same day surgery the patient usually is catherized and must return the following day to have it removed in summary this surgery can improve the quality of both partner is lives having medical conditions such as diabetes is most likely responsible for the ed your situation will most likely not respond adequately to pills creams injections or pumps i suggest interviewing multiple urologists before deciding on the
if obamacare is now law how can the president his family and congress be exempt  if it is good enough for the average citizen why will they not participate in the new health care system,the reason that you might be experiencing soreness in your knees could be due to a variety of different reasons i would first see how your body responds to doing other exercise that may be a little lower impact such as walking swimming kayaking water aerobics using the elliptical rowing stair climbing yoga or some strength training exercises you can determine if the problem is specific to the type of exercise that you are doing this way you might just be doing too much too soon with jogging try dialing back your current jogging routine by building in more days of rest in between exercise sessions spending less time per session or jogging at a slower pace you could also try experimenting by adding interval training into your routine where you incorporate intermittent bouts of jogging into your walking routine lastly try experimenting with different ground surfaces if you are jogging outside the grass or a dirt path might provide less impact than concrete also it might be worthwhile to invest in good pair of running shoes as well if your painsoreness persists in spite of making some of these changes then i would suggest meeting with a doctorspecialist and discontinuing jogging until you can find out what is causing this hi if you mean you knees and touching why you jog you need to change you jogging style but in the mean time get some baby oil or vaseline rubbed on them before you go out if that works you wont have to worry when you come home because there be alright stay fit stay healthy good luck
after sitting for 20 minutes and then standing up my hearing goes in and out in rythum with my heartbeat then goes away this happens regularly after sitting i am 51 59 180lbs muscular build,do you also get a little lightheaded during these episodes if so you are probably experiencing a bit of orthostatic hypotension which is a fancy term that means your blood pressure drops a bit when you stand up this can happen because gravity pulls blood down into your legs when you stand and it takes the body a moment to get that blood redistributed back up to the brain again even if you are not experiencing lightheadedness what you are hearing likely is the blood being pumped north after it is been pulled south when you stand up that whooshing you hear is the heart and baroreceptors working quickly to pump blood upstairs if this has started recently you might want to consider drinking more water orthostatic hypotension is by definition an issue of low blood pressure by increasing your water intake you will increase the overall volume in your blood vessels and possibly avoid the symptoms you describe orthostatic hypotension in and of itself usually is not dangerous but if you begin fainting or having trouble with balance then it is time to call the doctor because your symptoms could indicate some underlying problem i hope this helps

what are mini warts,you probably [do not] know much about mini warts or technically speaking molluscum contagiosum every summer parents bring their kids in with curious little “rashes” that just do not seem to go away they are tiny firm raised flesh colored bumps that often show up in the armpit the back of the knees the trunk the forearm or the inner thigh the only place they do not show up are the palms and soles  so what are they a virus yes these tiny warts are caused by a virus and yes that means they are contagious they spread from person to person by direct contact with the spots and kids can spread them around their own bodies by scratching and picking at them the spots are kind of itchy but they are really more of a nuisance than a serious health issue kids with eczema tend to have more problems because the itchy spots lead to scratching which leads to eczema flare ups if left alone the molluscum eventually goes away but “eventually” can mean 6 months or 4 years molluscum is not just a summer virus but i do see more kids with it after spending their summer in the swimming pool studies looking at the ability of the virus to spread in a chlorinated pool have been inconclusive thus far thus there are no regulations restricting kids from public swimming pools when they have got those spots besides the fact that one in 10 kids would have to stay out of a pool if there was a rule… that is how common molluscum is  the molluscum virus also seems to spread through non chlorinated water like your bathtub if one of your kids has molluscum do not let him share a bath or a drying off towel with your other kids about 40 of kids with molluscum will spread it to their sibling if you want to get rid of the molluscum before they decide to go away on their own i suggest speaking to your child is doctor or consulting a dermatologist there are a variety of methods none of which is 100 successful or pain free so you should consider the options before proceeding

stage 2 throat and neck cancer undergoing chemo and radiotherapy need second opinion,according to a recent study 85 percent of americans are washing their hands after using a public bathroom improved from 77 percent a few years ago the other 15 percent are contaminating the rest of our world nearly three times as many women wash their hands than men however apparently men have a prevailing assumption that if you do not pee on your fingers you do not need to wash your hands personally i am not overly worried about the pee guys but i do worry about the men behind those stall doors men is restrooms are considerably nastier than the women is facilities so i am told if i am forced to use a public restroom i try not to touch anything if i can help it i consider bathrooms stalls the most contaminated rooms on this planet i would love to put on some type of biological hazard suit but this is not practical i have seen impatient dancing women quickly use a men is room when the line to the women is restroom is too long it only takes one of these experiences to truly appreciate the difference for the first time i would like to reveal the inner workings of a typical men is room there is usually a bank of urinals against one wall about five men do not like to stand side by side with another man peeing so whenever possible an unused urinal becomes the “buffer ” some urinals have little walls between them but most are open there may or may not be a lower urinal for little boys in the stalls i would be shocked not to find urine on the seat even though urine is usually sterile no one wants to ever sit on it men like urinals sort of but little boys do not they are either too short to use them or too shy given a choice little boys head for the stall where they will freely pee on the seat the floor and the flush handle before finding their mark i would be shocked not to find sticky urine on the floor near the toilet men do not like to sit on strange toilets given the choice they prefer the one at home well stocked with reading material unlike women men have not developed the fine art of toilet seat hovering men are accustomed to sitting down and reading for a while women typically pee and leave no one really knows the best toilet stall to use i guess the best one would be the handicap stall but that is not very nice to occupy most will use the stall most distant from the door however you do tend to select the one that looks the cleanest and has a flushed toilet if you must use a stall you really do not want to pick a stall next to an actively occupied one it can be disconcerting to hear all of those bathroom noises next door or

ear ache continues for weeks after ear infection & antibiotics episode my son had an ear infection first week of july 2014 his pediatrician prescribed antibiotics ear drops after a week or so the swelling came down and my son was fine we still ensured that the antibiotics is used for the entire prescribed period however ever since that infection episode my son has been complaining of ear ache if something presses the ears   like helmet etc it does not pain all the time only when it is pressed,assuming you are female boys do not bother to wipe you should wipe front to back basically pushing the toilet tissue into the toilet if you wipe back to front you could be contaminating your vaginal area with bacteria that may have colonized around your rectal area when i instruct little children i tell them to push the paper into the potty never pull it out of the potty since most urinary tract infections in women are caused from bacteria that normally live in the rectumcolon proper bathroom hygiene is an important skill to learn and to practice wipe from front to back after using the bathroon the reasoning for this is to help prevent urinary tract infections try not to reach from behind because this could transfer germs from the rectum to your hands and the opening of the urethra as you wipe use the same direction when washing or showering after a bowel movement also wipe the from the front of the rectum to the back this answer is from diapering baby the healthy way but the same is true for adults women particularly should wipe from front to back to avoid infection hope this helps the webmd answers staff it is front to back to avoid bladder infections

is this a cyst why does it seem to be spreading  okay so first things first i have 3 hard bumps at the base of my penis first thing i did was go to planned parenthood and get tested for std is right away the dr looked at the bumps and said this definitely is not an std it is likely a sebaceous cyst if i had to guess the thing is when i researched those cysts they seemed to be filled with pus and fluid and when i have stabbed mine it is just a hard fleshy lump and nothing comes out but blood any thoughts or similar experiences,stop doing home surgery on your penis lumps before you get a secondary infection since i can not examine you first hand there is really no way for me to confirm or dispute the sebaceous cyst diagnosis so i would suggest that you see your primary care medical provider or a urologist for an expert opinion cysts tend to be filled with a cheesy material unless of course they are calcified which may be the case for you

how are dating relationships affected if a teenager has epilepsy,your doctors are not correct the government has absolutely no role in selecting which practices participate in the health plans being sold through the marketplaces rather it is private insurance companies and doctors together that decide whether they will engage in a business contract that is always been the case and the aca does nothing to change that however the law does place new requirements on insurers    chief among them that they can no longer deny people who are sick access to a health plan in response many carriers are reducing the size of the provider networks they offer as a way to manage their financial risk since they can no longer do so by refusing to cover sick people among other changes the idea is to offer smaller networks that they say are more efficient and cost effective to deliver care many patients however are simply finding they have fewer doctors from which to choose you have two options 1 review the list of doctors available in the plan you have and begin to receive your care from physicians who do participate 2 before the end of this month if you are not happy with your plan you may be able to switch to one that does include your doctors    if that is your doctors participate with any of them

i am only 31 but experiencing health issues associated with elderly people,i am very biased towards exercise in fact some studies have shown that exercise works as good or better than antidepressants for mild to moderate depression i know with a busy lifestyle it can be difficult to find time for exercise we often think in terms of being unable to find time for exercise instead we should turn our thinking around so that we are making time for exercise even if it is 20 minutes a day the benefits will more than pay off 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening can even do the trick if that is all the time you have ideally 30 minutes of steady exercise a few days a week is best here is more information on how truly wonderful exercise can be for depression if you are interested in supplements there are several that medical research has shown to be effective the supplements that have the most evidence to support them are same and st john is wort studies have shown that same may work as well as antidepressants the studies in this area are not great but the supplement certainly shows promise there is a lot of research showing st john is wort can help as well as some antidepressants it is been shown to improve mood and anxiety and improve sleep related to depression another possibility is 5 htp which again has been shown in some studies to work as well as certain antidepressants if you are already on an antidepressant you should definitely talk to your doctor before taking any supplement to make sure there are no drug interactions of course if you have not seen a doctor about your depression you absolutely should you want to make sure that is in fact what is going on and that you are getting the right treatment based on your depression everyone is different and you and your doctor know your body the best the two of you can work together to tackle your depression

how is tuberculosis treated,a person with a positive skin test a normal chest x ray and no symptoms most likely has only a few tb germs in an inactive state and is not contagious nevertheless treatment with an antibiotic may be recommended for this person to prevent the tb from turning into an active infection the antibiotic used for this purpose is called isoniazid if taken for six to 12 months it will prevent the tb from becoming active in the future in fact if a person with a positive skin test does not take inh there is a 5 10 lifelong risk that the tb will become active taking isoniazid can be inadvisable contraindicated during pregnancy or for those with alcoholism or liver disease also isoniazid can have side effects the side effects occur infrequently but a rash can develop and the patient can feel tired or irritable liver damage from isoniazid is a rare occurrence and typically reverses once the drug is stopped very rarely however especially in older people the liver damage inh hepatitis can even be fatal it is important therefore for the doctor to monitor a patient is liver by periodically ordering blood tests called liver function tests during the course of inh therapy another side effect of inh is a decreased sensation in the extremities referred to as a peripheral neuropathy this can be avoided by taking vitamin b6 pyridoxine and this is often prescribed along with inh a person with a positive skin test along with an abnormal chest x ray and sputum evidencing tb bacteria has active tb and is contagious active tb usually is accompanied by symptoms such as a cough fever weight loss and fatigue active tb is treated with a combination of medications along with isoniazid rifampin rifadin ethambutol myambutol and pyrazinamide are the drugs commonly used to treat active tb in conjunction with isoniazid inh four drugs are often taken for the first two months of therapy to help kill any potentially resistant strains of bacteria then the number is usually reduced to two drugs for the remainder of the treatment based on drug sensitivity testing that is usually available by this time in the course streptomycin a drug that is given by injection may be used as well particularly when the disease is extensive andor the patients do not take their oral medications reliably termed poor compliance treatment usually lasts for many months and sometimes for years successful treatment of tb is dependent largely on the compliance of the patient indeed the failure of a patient to take the medications is the most important cause of failure to cure the tb infection in some locations the health department demands direct monitoring of patient compliance with therapy surgery on the lungs may be indicated to help cure tb when medication has failed but in this day and age surgery for tb is unusual treatment with appropriate antibiotics will usually cure the tb without treatment however tuberculosis can be a lethal infection

my wife has terrible headaches constantly we did ct scan mri mra mrv but everything is normal no blood clot tumors etc,well first i am obligated to note that marijuana smoking is illegal under u s federal law even in states that regulate the use of medical marijuana but as to your question there should not be any conflict between cannabis use and vicodin hydrocodone cannabis is not an opioid the way hydrocodone is both substances provide mild pain relief so if anything cannabis might make you feel as if the pain relieving effect of the hydrocodone is enhanced that said it is generally not a good idea to mix drugs with similar properties such as pain relievers so your best bet is to avoid smoking marijuana while taking hydrocodone the hydrocodone should provide sufficient pain relief on its own if it does not please contact your health care provider for a different pain reliever there are plenty to choose from hope this helps

how is drug induced hair loss treated,it is important to review any medications you take and discuss their potential side effects with your doctor and pharmacist when hair loss does occur from a drug you are taking there is a good chance that the hair will grow back on its own after you stop taking the medication if stopping the drug does not improve hair thinning you may need to be treated with finasteride propecia or minoxidil rogaine medications that slow hair loss and can stimulate new hair growth one technique may help prevent hair loss during chemotherapy it is called scalp hypothermia and it involves placing ice packs on the scalp a few minutes before    and for about a half hour after    chemotherapy treatment cooling the scalp reduces blood flow to the hair follicles making it harder for the chemotherapy drugs to get into the follicular cells cooling also reduces biochemical activity making the hair follicles less susceptible to damage from chemotherapy drugs one concern with this technique is the risk of cancer recurrence in the scalp after chemotherapy treatment the hair usually grows back in very quickly but it may change in texture in rare cases the hair will stay thin even after treatment has been stopped minoxidil can help regrow hair that is slow to return some chemotherapy patients wear a wig or hat to hide their hair loss until their hair grows back

my husband is lethargic sleeps a lot during the day is losing weight and has no appetite,whether she wants to go or not is irrelevant she needs to go because she is having signs of a urinary tract infection perhaps one that is involving the kidney like a pyleonephritis she could also be passing a kidney stone either one of these could be serious so waiting is not a logical option as you know it is not normal to pee blood hematuria since the kidneys are located high in the back it would be in her best interest to seek medical care so she can be properly diagnosed and treated it may be up to use to convince here
i have had a strange itch on my clitoris for a few weeks now what may be causing this  my vagina does not itch at all but it is dry and has a sour smell every now and then the itch comes and goes throughout the day and is more annoying than anything else i use a feminine wash and a feminine deodorant spray i have tried to alter things by taking them away one by one and then adding them back to see if they were causing the problem but no luck strangely enough when i went on vacation to the beach for a week the itch went away but returned once i came back home,contact allergy could do it dryer softener sheets with perfume is high on my list followed by enzymatic detergents and bath soaps it could even be that feminine spray even if you have used it in the past products often change ingredients without changing the brand name a yeast infection is quite common in this area so if the itch is limited to the clitoral area use a topical antifungal perhaps mixed halfhalf with 1 hydrocortisone cream

does anyone out there know what sweets syndrome is,well not exactly the lung does not rupture  exactly it can collapse though this is called  pneumothorax  a broken rib can indeed puncture your lung in fact it is not all that uncommon if you watch any of those real life trauma shows on television you will see emergency room personnel placing chest tubes in patients due to collapsed lungs and you can bet some of those collapses occurred due to fractured ribs but if by cracked you mean not completely fractured or displaced  then the answer probably is no  when a rub breaks and the two sides pull away from each other then one of them can puncture the lung if a rib is cracked but the ends never comes apart then it is unlikely to penetrate the tissue surrounding the lung on the other hand if you took a forceful blow to the chest that alone could cause a collapsed not ruptured lung so if you experienced chest trauma sufficient to crack a rib you certainly could experience a pneumothorax surprisingly you can experience a collapsed lung without any known cause whatsoever wishing you well

does gargling with vodka kill germs in your throat  at the onset of a sore throat i have been gargling with warm salt water these past 30+ years but i just heard from a few friends that they gargle with vodka and that vodka kills the infections,in a laboratory petri dish i am sure that the alcohol in the vodka would kill some or all of the bacteria but the throat is not a petri dish there are many parts of the throat that vodka would not even touch these areas would rapidly re contaminate the non gargled areas so any partial benefit that you might achieve would be mitigated most sore throats are viral infections that only last about a week in adults most will improve on day three or four if you do nothing at all i would much prefer that you gargle with saline a weak salt water solution than to take a chance at aspirating vodka into your lungs this can happen and it would not be pleasant when you take health advice from your friends it can either be good advice or bad in this case the advise was not wise i would not recommend that you gargle with vodka
can dogs eat popcorn,the answer is probably if you are an adult body temperature readings can vary depending on how you take your temperature for example in an adult with no symptoms of illness a 96 9 armpit reading would not be considered abnormal at all even a 96 9 oral reading in an adult probably would not be any cause for concern a 96 9 rectal reading in an adult might be a bit unusual if you have symptoms of illness or have been exposed to frigid temperatures then that is a whole other story while most people run a fever when they become ill certain conditions and situations can cause a drop in core body temperature mild hypothermia is defined as a core body temperature below 95f if you are concerned about low body temperature especially if you are experiencing other symptoms i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider this information only applies to healthy adults temperature issues are different for infants children and the elderly    all of whom may be more susceptible to hypothermia hope this helps
vegetarian and hypoglycemia i have a rare form of cancer and recently converted to a mostly raw vegan diet in the last 3 4 months green juicing some carrot with lemonceleryapple and get my fats from avocado flaxolive oil and raw nuts that are soaked my grains are eziekiel brown rice oatmeal and quinoa protien is from brown rice protein powder chick peas lentils since i have been doing this diet   i believe i have developed hypoglycemia i am awaiting my specialist appt my blood work shows a level of 2 6 i wake up in the night extremely hungry and can not go back to sleep until i eat something after my oatmeal in the morning i feel sluggish i will go from not being hungry to being really hungry all of a sudden i have had my left eye blurr on me 2 3x and last about 5 minutes i have lost weight and muscle tone is it possible for someone with hypoglycemia to live on a veg diet i had turkey last nite for dinner   still woke up hungry thx,you would like to know whether someone with hypoglycemia can live on a vegetarian diet a vegetarian diet is a diet or lifestyle that seeks to exclude the use of animals for food properly planned vegan diets are healthful and have been found to satisfy nutritional needs poorly planned vegan diets can be low in levels of calcium iodine vitamin b12 and vitamin d vegans are therefore encouraged to plan their diet and take dietary supplements such as vitamin b12 vitamin d calcium iodine and omega 3 fatty acids these deficiencies have potentially serious consequences including anemia rickets and cretinism in children and osteomalacia and hypothyroidism in adults given the data that you provided of hypoglycemia hunger blurred vision of your left eye and weight loss it is likely that you experience them because your body is not adjusting to that diet and the low calorie intake since you experience thyroid cancer the needs for energy are increased because the cancer causes the metabolism to work faster and to spend the energy faster if the body does not have enough energy it starts to lose in weight and hypoglycemia is the consequence you may consider changing the diet back to normal or to increase the energy intake while still vegetarian but to take more vitamin mineral and omega 3 fatty acids supplements please keep in mind that i provide medical information only i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online please contact your doctor or other healthcare provider such as nutritionist for further advice and information

food with cooked wine if pregnant  my wife is 6 weeks pregnant and i was cooking pot roast with bottle of wine cooked off over 2 hours in it i forgot alchohol issue is it safe or should she not eat this,absolutely cardio exercise including aerobics is one of the best things you can do to lose belly fat and fat anywhere strive for 30 minutes of moderate cardio exercise aerobics fast walkingjogging elliptical biking etc at least 5 days per week on a 10 point scale moderate means you are working at about a level 5 or 6 if you do not have this much time you can pump up the intensity to vigorous exercise and slim down the time to 20 minutes and get the same benefit vigorous exercise would be a 7 to 8 on a 10 point scale in fact if you do vigorous exercise 3 days a week should do the trick of course the more you do the more fat and calories you will burn interval training is a great way to get your body used to vigorous exercise to start do 2 minutes of moderate alternating with 30 seconds of vigorous for 20 minutes as you get in better shape you can increase the vigorous exercise time good luck aerobic exercise is great to help expend calories and boost metabolism to promote weight loss keep in mind however that you can not “spot reduce” weight loss meaning that you can not do a certain exercise to target weight loss from a particular part of your body the surgeon general recommends 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise 5 days per week 60 minutes is even better if your goal is to lose weight these recommendations are cut in half however if you do vigorous intensity exercise instead of moderate intensity also be sure to also include strength training into your routine as well visit this cdc website for more information on exercise recommendations yes i have been told that plain old mind numbing cardio plugging away on a treadmill elliptical recumbent bike etc is by far the worst way to lost fat belly or otherwise yes interval training is better but even better is to lift weights less weight more reps with the cardio occurring in between sets because you rest 30 secs and move on to the next set google fat loss and weight lifting and you will see the preponderance of the evidence on the side of weights with inherent cardio is the best method works for me fordjohna you can not spot reduce fat you need to lose it all over with diet and heavy lifting

could you provide a few links to the major studies showing excessive saturated fat is unhealthy  this website and the american heart association continue to recommend a diet low in saturated fat but the current buzz on the internet is that there is really little evidence for that position in fact france eats a diet high in saturated fat yet has a low rate of deaths from heart disease <link> <link>  can i see links to the original studies showing sf is harmful,most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets the truth is diets low in saturated fat will not reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs this decreases hdl good cholesterol and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat omega 3 fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats it decreases heart disease risk    hdl increases and ldl bad cholesterol decreases <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet    low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables while the evidence continues to evolve there is not enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease yes some propit change to lipid and make your belt bigger see more here hi for those who have interest in saturated fat have a good read through this one site there is lots on it <link> just copy link into google to the www to open and read should help some of you good luck our old belief was that saturated fat have the ability to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks but s everal recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease h owever it is a fact that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events by 14 so it is always better to stay away from a fatty body i had a very fatty body from my childhood it self but by doing a plastic surgery procedure at montreal omar fouda neel clinic i reduced overall body fat and there by weight i think the links you have are pretty awesome sf is are great just really need to have them in moderation i would think

why are whole foods good for me,what is the easiest way to improve your health and prevent disease it is simple eat more whole foods and less processed foods most of us know that it is better to eat a handful of nuts instead of a nutty granola bar or to build a meal around a skinless chicken breast rather than a chicken nugget or to include a side of cooked red potatoes instead of potato chips or french fries it is even preferable nutritionally to enjoy cooked green soybeans edamame compared to soy powder or some soy based sausage or product that has been processed that was pretty much the bottom line in my book food synergy whole foods have more of the nutrients we want and less of the added ingredients we do not want sugar sodium saturated and trans fat etc  but they also have important nutrients and phytochemicals in natural amounts and combinations so what are whole foods these are foods that are eaten as close to their natural form as possible with minimal processing and refinement examples include fruits vegetables nuts legumes unprocessed fish lean meat oats and other whole grains they can be cooked mind you without being “processed ” eating a meal comprised mostly of whole foods compared to processed food is more likely to * offer a powerful combination of important vitamins minerals fiber protein and antioxidants * contribute smart fats — omega 3s from fish and plants and monounsaturated fat from plants the bad for you fats are often added to processed foods and fast food  * pump up the fiber which helps you feel full faster helps fights heart disease and diabetes and helps keep the gi tract moving and happy * make it easier to cut down on extra amounts of calories sugar sodium trans and saturated fat * amp up antioxidant plant components or phytochemicals

why should i be careful ordering a hamburger,where did all the quarter pounders go suddenly half pound hamburgers are all you see on restaurant menus anymore how is this a good thing sure you could split the burger with someone but what are the odds that your meal companion is also going to want a burger the other option is to cut it in half and take the other half home but you are not always going to be able to safely deliver the leftovers to your refrigerator within two hours plus you probably do not want to eat a hamburger two days in a row sounds a little nutty but we actually played this out this scenario at the table a few weeks ago when my daughter wanted to order a hamburger in a restaurant that only offered half pounders we ended up telling the servers to make a quarter pounder patty instead for her still paid for the half pounder though over the next few weeks we noticed that several other restaurants only offered half pound burgers as well i was hoping we were going in the opposite direction and eating smaller burgers not larger ones share the monster burger and you would still be getting around 400 calories 23 grams of fat and 10 grams of saturated fat perhaps it is simply better to look for a more healthful menu option

how can i bleed less when i get off the shot,are they eating a large or late snack in the afternoon i am surprised that both children are not very hungry at dinnertime if you were to give a snack 1 hour before dinner i am concerned that it would further reduce their appetite for dinner i would offer a reasonable serving size at dinner children should not generally have to clean their plates however if you do not think that they ate reasonably then dessert should be withheld dessert can be given later in the evening as a small bedtime snack if they ate reasonably for dinner from a convenience standpoint for you i would discourage having dinner served in two halves

what is hypothyroidism,intuniv is a newly approved medication for the treatment of adhd it is the second non stimulant approved for adhd with strattera being the first although intuniv is a new medication it is actually a new delivery system for an old medication intuniv is a long acting formulation of guanfacine    which was available in a short acting form for decades as tenex i prescribed tenex in the 1980 is guanfacine was originally approved for the treatment of high blood pressure in adults and it was subesequently noted to help with adhd symptoms and tics although tenex is not approved for treatment of adhd it has been used selectively in some patients for many many years although it is not generally as effective a medication as the stimulants are it does have certain advantages it does not cause insomnia or appetite loss and it is not a controlled substance prone to abuse also since it is sometimes used in patients who also have tics you can sometimes get a two fer out of the medication since it will improve both adhd and tics whereas guanfacine is a very cheap medication in its short acting form but needs to be given typically 3xday intuniv is a more expensive medication you pay a premium for the convenience of once a day dosing the manuacturer would like clinicians to believe that once a day intuniv is clinically better than the short acting guanfacine given repeatedly however i am not aware of any studies to prove that whatsoever

after every meal i get a really uncomfortable bloated feeling gasy and feeling extremely tired what may cause this  i took a pregnancy test and am not pregnant  i thought it was a lactose intolerance but have found that is not it after doing a lactose free diet,when you look at your dietary intake be conscious of both quantity and quality of the foods that you eat my initial thoughts are that your feelings of being uncomfortable and bloated might be because you are eating too fast or too much at one time the first thing i would suggest that you try is to cut back on how much you eat in one sitting making sure that you eat your food slowly and chew thoroughly try eating a small portion of a meal waiting 15 minutes and then consuming more of your meal if you are still hungry you could also try to eat 5 6 smaller more frequent meals throughout the entire day as well also important to consider is the type of foods that you are eating you may notice some of these symptoms if you are not eating healthy in general i would recommend food journaling your dietary intake so that you can begin to notice trends between what you are eating and when you feel this way some foods may cause you to feel more bloated and to have more gas naturally but you may also have a food intolerance sensitivity or allergy you can meet with your doctor to have an allergy test but those are not always 100 accurate registered dietitians will often recommend an elimination diet to help determine if there are certain foods that your body will not tolerate an elimination diet begins by being very restrictive with your food intake followed by gradually reintroducing more food into your diet once you notice symptoms returning you can begin to better identify which foods are causing the problems you are experiencing please meet with your doctor or a registered dietitian for more guidance i feel full and bloated all the time now for the past two months i eat very healthy and am not on any medications my sister now has the same symptoms i am 30 and she is 40 we are not pregnant but as you did we also took tests because it felt similar to when we were pregnant did you go to the doctor are you still bloated i cannot believe how long it is lasting i was checking my hormone levels too i fill up with gas for no reason   like it is in the air or something please answer back if you had any resolutions to your problem

i have pain at the base of my thumb by the wrist chronic pain weakness tenderness to touch,most helpful answer so sorry to hear you are dealing with this pain is never fun the symptoms you are describing could be caused by several things ranging from injury striking your hand against an object for example to repetitive motion strain such as from using a video game controller for hours on end treating the symptoms may be based in part on what is causing them so your best bet is to get checked out by your primary care provider he or she will evaluate the problem possibly order some tests x ray for example and then develop an appropriate treatment plan for you so while this certainly is not an emergency situation it would be a good idea to have this problem checked out before it gets any worse good luck to you

how can i avoid midlife weight gain,benadryl is very effective for hives because of the fast onset of the medication but only lasts about four hours zyrtec tends to be slower in onset but lasts longer 24 hours both are antihistamines of course and most of the time you only need one of the other on some occasions however when you have taken zyrtec in the 24 hours you can still get hives so it is safe to take a dose of benadryl benadryl does cause sedation so please be careful if you need to drive if the hives do not clear up fairly quickly or if they are accompanied by difficulty breathing your wife should seek immediate medical attention these can be the signs of a severe allergic reaction to something    food medication etc if your wife gets hives occasionally as some people do and they are not accompanied by other symptoms then i would suggest she speak to her doctor about getting a prescription specifically for the hives there are medications other than benadryl that are used to treat hives in terms of combining antihistamines i would suggest you speak to a pharmacist while benadryl diphenhydramine has a different chemical composition than zyrtec cetirizine they still are both the same class of medication generally we try not to combine medications of the same class unless specifically directed to do so by a physician i hope that gives you some clarity why would you want to take two antihistamines you may want to talk to a doctor and get a stronger prescription antihistamine if either of these are not very effective for you

how much will i be fined if i do not get insurance,well  in 2014 two very important rules change the most important is that insurance companies will be forbidden by law from denying coverage to americans with pre existing health conditions right now insurance companies can lock people out of the market or price people out of the market that will no longer be allowed come 2014 people will with a pre existing health condition be able to buy coverage be able to participate in a pool in order to make sure that that happens and that we have a solvent insurance pool there is an additional feature that says everyone needs to participate so most people right now have access to employer based coverage or indeed carry their own coverage or they qualify for a public program a limited number of people are not in those categories at all and most of those folks do not have the finances to buy insurance coverage on their own so starting in 2014 there will be a personal responsibility provision that says everybody needs to participate if you are in the exchange and need some financial assistance based on your income that will be available if you have employer coverage you are covered if you are purchasing insurance on your own you will have an opportunity to purchase that coverage in the insurance exchange if you qualify for public programs you are covered so we think that the vast majority of people and this has been the case in massachusetts where they have an exchange set up with very similar rules the vast majority of people who do not have insurance really would love to have coverage for themselves and their families they just can not afford it and those days will be over if indeed somebody can afford coverage when we get to 2014 and refuses to pay for coverage there is a financial penalty and it is really paying for the health service that that person and their family may well access what we know is if someone has an automobile accident and is taken to a hospital they are going to get health care if they have a stroke or if a family member has cancer they will have health care they just will be shifting those costs onto everyone else onto taxpayers and hospitals and everyone who buys coverage so there is an employer responsibility piece there is a government responsibility piece and there is an individual responsibility component of the new health care law

when i gave birth i tore very very badly urine is now inside my vaginal canal,stds no there is a reason why they are called sexually transmitted diseases you do not generally pick them up off of surfaces hepatitis is a remote possibility but the odds are really against it if this is a concern to you there are some simple things to keep yourself safe wash your hands after you go to the bathroom and before you eat try not to touch your eyes mouth and pimples without washing your hands first cover your cuts besides a cut would have to be open and bleeding to be much of an entrance to your body skin and scabs make a pretty good barrier to disease and many viruses die quickly so hand washing cover your cuts do not touch your eyes nose and mouth very much simple as that
